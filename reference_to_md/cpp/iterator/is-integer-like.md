### Integer-class type

A type `T` is an _integer-class type_ if it is in a set of implementation-defined types that behave as [integer types](../language/types.html#Integral_types "cpp/language/types") do, as defined [below](is-integer-like.html#Required_behaviors). An integer-class type is not necessarily a [class type](../language/classes.html "cpp/language/classes"). 

An integer-class type can represent \\(\scriptsize 2^N \\)2N  
consecutive integers, where N, a positive integer, is called the _width_ of the integer-class type. 

An integer-class type is either signed or unsigned: 

  * A _signed integer class type_ can represent all integers in `[`\\(\scriptsize -2^{N-1} \\)-2N-1  
`, `\\(\scriptsize 2^{N-1}-1 \\)2N-1  
-1`]`, where N is greater than the width of every signed integral type. 
  * An _unsigned integer class type_ can represent all integers in `[`\\(\scriptsize 0 \\)0`, `\\(\scriptsize 2^N-1 \\)2N  
-1`]`, where N is greater than the width of every unsigned integral type. 



All integer-class types model [`regular`](../concepts/regular.html "cpp/concepts/regular") and [`three_way_comparable`](../utility/compare/three_way_comparable.html "cpp/utility/compare/three way comparable")<[std::strong_ordering](../utility/compare/strong_ordering.html)>. 

A [value-initialized](../language/value_initialization.html "cpp/language/value initialization") object of integer-class type has value ​0​. 

An expression E of integer-class type `T` is [contextually convertible](../language/implicit_cast.html#Contextual_conversions "cpp/language/implicit conversion") to bool as if by bool(E != T(0)). 

### Integer-like type

A type other than (possibly cv-qualified) bool is _integer-like_ if it models [`integral`](../concepts/integral.html "cpp/concepts/integral") or if it is an integer-class type. 

  * An integer-like type is _signed-integer-like_ if it models [`signed_integral`](../concepts/signed_integral.html "cpp/concepts/signed integral") or if it is a signed-integer-class type. 
  * An integer-like type is _unsigned-integer-like_ if it models [`unsigned_integral`](../concepts/unsigned_integral.html "cpp/concepts/unsigned integral") or if it is an unsigned-integer-class type. 



### Required behaviors

Expressions of integer-class type are explicitly convertible to any integer-like type, and implicitly convertible to any integer-class type of equal or greater width and the same signedness. Expressions of integral type are both implicitly and explicitly convertible to any integer-class type. Conversions between integral and integer-class types and between two integer-class types do not exit via an exception. The result of such a conversion is the unique value of the destination type that is congruent to the source modulo \\(\scriptsize 2^N \\)2N  
, where N is the width of the destination type. 

Let `Int<T>` denote the following type: 

  * If `T` is an integer-class type, `Int<T>` is a unique hypothetical [extended integer type](../language/types.html#Extended_integer_types "cpp/language/types") of the same signedness with the same width as `T`. 
  * If `T` is an integral type, let `Int<T>` is the same type as `T`. 



Given the following types, values and operators: 

Type  |  Definition   
---|---  
`IC` |  an integer-class type   
`IL` |  an integer-like type   
Value  |  Definition   
a |  an object of type `IC`  
b |  an object of type `IL`  
c |  an lvalue of an integeral type   
x |  an object of type `Int<IC>` that represent the same value as a  
y |  an object of type `Int<IL>` that represent the same value as b  
Operator  |  Definition   
@= |  one of +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<= and >>=  
@ |  one of +, -, *, /, %, &, |, ^, <<, >>, &&, ||, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, <=> and ,  
  
The following expressions must be well-formed and have their specified result and effects if the specified conditions are satisfied: 

Expression  |  Condition  | Result  | Effects   
---|---|---|---  
a++ |  No condition | a prvalue of type `IC` whose value is equal to that of a prior to the evaluation  | modifies the value of a by adding 1 to it   
a\-- | modifies the value of a by subtracting 1 to it   
++a | [expression-equivalent](../language/expressions.html#Expression-equivalence "cpp/language/expressions") to a += 1  
\--a | expression-equivalent to a -= 1  
&a | expression-equivalent to [std::addressof](../memory/addressof.html)(a)  
!a | !x is well-formed  | same as !x  
+a | +x is well-formed  | same as +x, but has type `IC` | same as +x  
-a | -x is well-formed  | same as -x, but has type `IC` | same as -x  
~a | ~x is well-formed  | same as ~x, but has type `IC` | same as ~x  
c @= a | c @= x is well-formed  | an lvalue referring to c | same as c @= x  
a @= b | x @= y is well-formed  | an lvalue referring to a | same as x @= y, except that the value that would be stored into x is stored into a  
a @ b | x @ y is well-formed  | same as x @ y, but the result type is different: 

  * If x @ y is of type `Int<IC>`, the result has type `IC`. 
  * If x @ y is of type `Int<IL>`, the result has type `IL`. 
  * If x @ y is of any other type `T`, the result has type `T`. 

| same as x @ y  
b @ a | y @ x is well-formed  | same as y @ x, but the result type is different: 

  * If y @ x is of type `Int<IC>`, the result has type `IC`. 
  * If y @ x is of type `Int<IL>`, the result has type `IL`. 
  * If y @ x is of any other type `T`, the result has type `T`. 

| same as y @ x
