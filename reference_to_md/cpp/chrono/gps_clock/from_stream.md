Attempts to parse the input stream is into the time point tp according to the format string fmt. 

Behaves as an [UnformattedInputFunction](../../named_req/UnformattedInputFunction.html "cpp/named req/UnformattedInputFunction"), except that it has an unspecified effect on is.gcount(). After constructing and checking the sentry object, attempts to parse the input stream is into tp according to the format string fmt. If the parse fails to decode a valid time point, is.setstate([std::ios_base::failbit](../../io/ios_base/iostate.html)) is called and tp is not modified. 

If the format specifier `%Z` is used and successfully parsed, the parsed value is assigned to *abbrev if abbrev is not null. If the format specifier `%z` or a modified variant is used and successfully parsed, the parsed value is assigned to *offset if offset is not null, and the parsed offset will be subtracted from the parsed timestamp before the difference is assigned to tp.

### Parameters

is  |  \-  |  an input stream   
---|---|---  
fmt  |  \-  |  a format string (see below)   
tp  |  \-  |  time point object to hold the parse result   
abbrev  |  \-  |  if not null, pointer to an object that will hold the time zone abbreviation or name corresponding to the `%Z` specifier   
offset  |  \-  |  if not null, pointer to an object that will hold the offset from UTC corresponding to the `%z` specifier   
  
### Format string

The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary characters. Each ordinary character, excluding whitespace characters and the terminating null character, matches one identical character from the input stream, or causes the function to fail if the next character on the stream does not compare equal. 

Each whitespace character matches zero or more whitespace characters in the input stream. 

Each unmodified conversion specifier begins with a `%` character followed by a character that determines the behavior of the specifier. Some conversion specifiers have a modified form in which an `E` or `O` modifier character is inserted after the `%` character. Some conversion specifiers have a modified form in which a width parameter given as a positive decimal integer (shown as _`N`_ below) is inserted after the `%` character. Each conversion specifier causes the matched characters to be interpreted as parts of date and time types according to the table below. 

A character sequence in the format string that begins with a `%` but does not match one of the conversion specifiers below is interpreted as ordinary characters. 

If `from_stream` fails to parse everything specified by the format string, or if insufficient information is parsed to specify a complete result, or if parsing discloses contradictory information, is.setstate([std::ios_base::failbit](../../io/ios_base/iostate.html)) is called. 

The following conversion specifiers are available: 

Conversion  
specifier  |  Explanation   
---|---  
`%%` |  Matches a literal `%` character.   
`%n` |  Matches one whitespace character.   
`%t` |  Matches zero or one whitespace character.   
Year   
`%C`   
`%_N_ C`   
`%EC` |  Parses the century as a decimal number. The width _N_ specifies the maximum number of characters to read. The default width is 2. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required. The modified command `%EC` interprets the locale's alternative representation of the century.
