This page tries to list all the symbols that were available from the [standard library](../standard_library.html "cpp/standard library") in the namespace std or in the scope of a scoped enumeration or a class, but removed in following standards. The symbols are written as follows: 

  * Function names with `()`. 
  * Templates with `<>`. 



Member names that are still available in other types are not listed here.
