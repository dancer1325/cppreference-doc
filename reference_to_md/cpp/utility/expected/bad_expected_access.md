template< class E >  
class bad_expected_access : public std::bad_expected_access<void> |  (1)  |  (since C++23)

1) Defines a type of object to be thrown by [`std::expected::value`](value.html "cpp/utility/expected/value") when accessing an expected object that contains an unexpected value. `bad_expected_access<E>` stores a copy of the unexpected value.

2) bad_expected_access<void> is the base class of all other `bad_expected_access` specializations.

All member functions of `std::bad_expected_access` are constexpr: it is possible to create and use `std::bad_expected_access` objects in the evaluation of a constant expression.However, `std::bad_expected_access` objects generally cannot be constexpr, because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression. | (since C++26)

### Members of the primary template

**(constructor)** |  constructs a `bad_expected_access` object   
(public member function)  
---|---  
error |  returns the stored value   
(public member function)  
what |  returns the explanatory string   
(public member function)  
  
##  std::bad_expected_access::bad_expected_access

explicit bad_expected_access( E e ); |  | (since C++23)   
(constexpr since C++26)  
---|---|---  
| |   
  
Constructs a new `bad_expected_access<E>` object. Initializes the stored value with `std::move(e)`. 

##  std::bad_expected_access::error

const E& error() const & noexcept; |  (1) | (since C++23)   
(constexpr since C++26)  
---|---|---  
E& error() & noexcept; |  (2) | (since C++23)   
(constexpr since C++26)  
const E&& error() const && noexcept; |  (3) | (since C++23)   
(constexpr since C++26)  
E&& error() && noexcept; |  (4) | (since C++23)   
(constexpr since C++26)  
| |   
  
Returns a reference to the stored value. 

##  std::bad_expected_access::what

const char* what() const noexcept override; |  | (since C++23)   
(constexpr since C++26)  
---|---|---  
| |   
  
Returns the explanatory string. 

###  Return value

Pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a [std::wstring](../../string/basic_string.html "cpp/string/basic string"). The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g., copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called. 

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.  | (since C++26)  
---|---  
  
###  Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override `what()`. 

##  Inherited from std::bad_expected_access<void>

###  Members of the bad_expected_access<void> specialization

(constructor) |  constructs a bad_expected_access<void> object   
(protected member function)  
---|---  
(destructor) |  destroys the bad_expected_access<void> object   
(protected member function)  
operator= |  replaces the bad_expected_access<void> object   
(protected member function)  
what |  returns the explanatory string   
(public member function)  
  
Special member functions of bad_expected_access<void> are protected. They can only be called by derived classes. 

##  Inherited from [std::exception](../../error/exception.html "cpp/error/exception")

###  Member functions

[ (destructor)](../../error/exception/~exception.html "cpp/error/exception/~exception")[virtual] |  destroys the exception object

---|---  
[ what](../../error/exception/what.html "cpp/error/exception/what")[virtual] |  returns an explanatory string   
(virtual public member function of `std::exception`)
