**FLT_EVAL_METHOD**(C++11)  
  


Defined in header `[<cfloat>](../../header/cfloat.html "cpp/header/cfloat")` |  |   
---|---|---  
#define FLT_EVAL_METHOD /* implementation-defined */ |  |  (since C++11)  
| |   
  
Specifies the precision in which all floating-point arithmetic operations other than assignment and cast are done. 

Value  |  Explanation   
---|---  
negative values except -1 |  implementation-defined behavior   
-1 |  the default precision is not known   
​0​ |  all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of the type used. Additionally, float_t and double_t are equivalent to float and double respectively   
1 |  all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of double. Additionally, both float_t and double_t are equivalent to double  
2 |  all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of long double. Additionally, both float_t and double_t are equivalent to long double  
  
### Notes

Regardless of the value of FLT_EVAL_METHOD, any floating-point expression may be _contracted_ , that is, calculated as if all intermediate results have infinite range and precision (unless [` #pragma`](../../preprocessor/impl.html "cpp/preprocessor/impl") STDC FP_CONTRACT is off). 

Cast and assignment strip away any extraneous range and precision: this models the action of storing a value from an extended-precision FPU register into a standard-sized memory location.
