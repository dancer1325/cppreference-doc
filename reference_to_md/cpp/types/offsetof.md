Defined in header `[<cstddef>](../header/cstddef.html "cpp/header/cstddef")` |  |   
---|---|---  
#define offsetof(type, member) /* implementation-defined */ |  |   
| |   
  
The macro **offsetof** expands to an integral constant expression of type [std::size_t](size_t.html "cpp/types/size t"), the value of which is the offset, in bytes, from the beginning of an object of specified type to its specified subobject, including [padding bits](../language/objects.html#Object_representation_and_value_representation "cpp/language/object") if any. 

Given an object o of type `type` and static storage duration, o.member shall be an lvalue constant expression that refers to a subobject of o. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined. Particularly, if `member` is a [static data member](../language/static.html "cpp/language/static"), a [bit-field](../language/bit_field.html "cpp/language/bit field"), or a [member function](../language/member_functions.html "cpp/language/member functions"), the behavior is undefined. 

If `type` is not a [PODType](../named_req/PODType.html "cpp/named req/PODType")(until C++11)[standard-layout](../language/data_members.html#Standard-layout "cpp/language/data members") type(since C++11), the result of `offsetof` is undefined(until C++17)use of the `offsetof` macro is conditionally-supported(since C++17). 

The expression offsetof(type, member) is never [type-dependent](../language/dependent_name.html#Dependent_types "cpp/language/dependent name") and it is value-dependent if and only if `type` is dependent.

### Exceptions

`offsetof` throws no exceptions. 

The expression noexcept(offsetof(type, member)) always evaluates to true.  | (since C++11)  
---|---  
  
### Notes

The offset of the first member of a standard-layout type is always zero ([empty-base optimization](../language/ebo.html "cpp/language/ebo") is mandatory).  | (since C++11)  
---|---  
  
`offsetof` cannot be implemented in standard C++ and requires compiler support: [GCC](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/68ec60c4a377b532ec2d265ea542107c36b1d15c/gcc/ginclude/stddef.h#L406), [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/release_70/lib/Headers/stddef.h#L120). 

`member` is not restricted to a direct member. It can denote a subobject of a given member, such as an element of an array member. This is specified by [C DR 496](https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2396.htm#dr_496). 

It is specified in C23 that defining a new type containing an unparenthesized comma in `offsetof` is undefined behavior, and such usage is generally not supported by implementations in C++ modes: offsetof(struct Foo { int a, b; }, a) is rejected by all known implementations. 

### Example

Run this code
    
    
    #include <cstddef>
    #include <iostream>
     
    struct S
    {
        char   m0;
        double m1;
        short  m2;
        char   m3;
    //  private: int z; // warning: 'S' is a non-standard-layout type
    };
     
    int main()
    {
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html)
            << "offset of char   m0 = " << offsetof(S, m0) << '\n'
            << "offset of double m1 = " << offsetof(S, m1) << '\n'
            << "offset of short  m2 = " << offsetof(S, m2) << '\n'
            << "offset of char   m3 = " << offsetof(S, m3) << '\n';
    }

Possible output: 
    
    
    offset of char   m0 = 0
    offset of double m1 = 8
    offset of short  m2 = 16
    offset of char   m3 = 18

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. 

DR  | Applied to  | Behavior as published  | Correct behavior   
---|---|---|---  
[CWG 273](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/273.html) | C++98  | `offsetof` may not work if unary `operator&` is overloaded  | required to work correctly even  
if `operator&` is overloaded   
[LWG 306](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue306) | C++98  | the behavior was not specified when `type` is not a [PODType](../named_req/PODType.html "cpp/named req/PODType") | the result is undefined in this case   
[LWG 449](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue449) | C++98  | other requirements of `offsetof` were  
removed by the resolution of [LWG issue 306](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue306) | added them back
