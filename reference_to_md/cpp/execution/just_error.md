inline constexpr just_error_t just_error{};  
struct just_error_t { /*unspecified*/ }; |  |  (since C++26)   
(customization point object)  
Call signature |  |   
execution::sender auto just_error( auto&& error ); |  |  (since C++26)  
| |   
  
A sender factory that returns a sender which completes immediately by calling the receiver’s [`set_error()`](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/execution/set_error&action=edit&redlink=1 "cpp/execution/set error \(page does not exist\)"). 

Let e be a subexpression represented by an input error which will be injected and returned by the receiver. The expression just_error(e) is [expression-equivalent](../language/expressions.html#Expression-equivalence "cpp/language/expressions") to /*make-sender*/(just_error, /*product-type*/(e))

###  Customization point objects

The name `execution::just_error` denotes a _customization point object_ , which is a const [function object](../named_req/FunctionObject.html "cpp/named req/FunctionObject") of a [literal](../named_req/LiteralType.html "cpp/named req/LiteralType") [`semiregular`](../concepts/semiregular.html "cpp/concepts/semiregular") class type. The cv-unqualified version of its type is a tag type denoted as `execution::just_error_t`. See [CustomizationPointObject](../named_req/CustomizationPointObject.html "cpp/named req/CustomizationPointObject") for details. 

### Notes

If the provided error is an lvalue reference, a copy is made inside the returned sender and a non-const lvalue reference to the copy is sent to the receiver’s set_error. If the provided value is an rvalue reference, it is moved into the returned sender and an rvalue reference to it is sent to the receiver’s `set_error`.
