The preprocessor supports conditional compilation of parts of source file. This behavior is controlled by `#if`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elifdef`, `#elifndef`(since C++23), and `#endif` directives.

### Explanation

The conditional preprocessing block starts with `#if`, `#ifdef` or `#ifndef` directive, then optionally includes any number of `#elif`, `#elifdef`, or `#elifndef`(since C++23) directives, then optionally includes at most one `#else` directive and is terminated with `#endif` directive. Any inner conditional preprocessing blocks are processed separately. 

Each of `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, `#elifdef`, `#elifndef`(since C++23), and `#else` directives control the code block until the first `#elif`, `#elifdef`, `#elifndef`(since C++23), `#else`, `#endif` directive not belonging to any inner conditional preprocessing blocks. 

`#if`, `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` directives test the specified condition (see below) and if it evaluates to true, compiles the controlled code block. In that case subsequent `#else`, `#elifdef`, `#elifndef`,(since C++23) and `#elif` directives are ignored. Otherwise, if the specified condition evaluates false, the controlled code block is skipped and the subsequent `#else`, `#elifdef`, `#elifndef`,(since C++23) or `#elif` directive (if any) is processed. If the subsequent directive is `#else`, the code block controlled by the `#else` directive is unconditionally compiled. Otherwise, the `#elif`, `#elifdef`, or `#elifndef`(since C++23) directive acts as if it was `#if` directive: checks for condition, compiles or skips the controlled code block based on the result, and in the latter case processes subsequent `#elif`, `#elifdef`, `#elifndef`,(since C++23) and `#else` directives. The conditional preprocessing block is terminated by `#endif` directive. 

### Condition evaluation

#### #if, #elif

expression may contain unary operators in form `**defined**` identifier or `**defined (**` identifier`**)**`. The result is 1 if the identifier was [defined as a macro name](replace.html "cpp/preprocessor/replace"), otherwise the result is ​0​. 

expression may also contain the following expressions: 

  * [`__has_include`](include.html "cpp/preprocessor/include") expressions, which detects whether a header or source file exists. 

| 

  * [`__has_cpp_attribute`](../experimental/feature_test.html#Attributes "cpp/feature test") expressions, which detects whether a given attribute token is supported and its supported version. 

| (since C++20)  
---|---  
  
  * [`__has_embed`](embed.html "cpp/preprocessor/embed") expressions, which detects whether a resource is available to be embedded. 

| (since C++26)  
  
The identifiers mentioned above are treated as if they were the names of defined macros in this context. 

(since C++17)  
  
After all macro expansion and evaluation `defined` and the expressions described above, any identifier which is not a [boolean literal](../language/bool_literal.html "cpp/language/bool literal") is replaced with the number ​0​ (this includes identifiers that are lexically keywords, but not alternative tokens like and). 

Then the expression is evaluated as an [integral constant expression](../language/constant_expression.html#Integral_constant_expression "cpp/language/constant expression"). 

If the expression evaluates to nonzero value, the controlled code block is included and skipped otherwise. 

Note: Until the resolution of [CWG issue 1955](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/1955.html), `#if _cond1_` ... `#elif _cond2_` is different from `#if _cond1_` ... `#else` followed by `#if _cond2_` because if `_cond1_` is true, the second `#if` is skipped and `_cond2_` does not need to be well-formed, while `#elif`'s `_cond2_` must be a valid expression. As of CWG 1955, `#elif` that leads the skipped code block is also skipped. 

#### Combined directives

Checks if the identifier was [defined as a macro name](replace.html "cpp/preprocessor/replace"). 

`#ifdef` identifier is essentially equivalent to `#if defined` identifier. 

`#ifndef` identifier is essentially equivalent to `#if !defined` identifier. 

`#elifdef` identifier is essentially equivalent to `#elif defined` identifier. `#elifndef` identifier is essentially equivalent to `#elif !defined` identifier.  | (since C++23)

### Notes

While `#elifdef` and `#elifndef` directives target C++23, implementations are encouraged to backport them to the older language modes as conforming extensions. 

### Example

Run this code
    
    
    #define ABCD 2
    #include <iostream>
     
    int main()
    {
     
    #ifdef ABCD
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "1: yes\n";
    #else
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "1: no\n";
    #endif
     
    #ifndef ABCD
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "2: no1\n";
    #elif ABCD == 2
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "2: yes\n";
    #else
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "2: no2\n";
    #endif
     
    #if !defined(DCBA) && (ABCD < 2*4-3)
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "3: yes\n";
    #endif
     
     
    // Note that if a compiler does not support C++23's #elifdef/#elifndef
    // directives then the "unexpected" block (see below) will be selected.
    #ifdef CPU
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no1\n";
    #elifdef GPU
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no2\n";
    #elifndef RAM
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: yes\n"; // expected block
    #else
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no!\n"; // unexpectedly selects this block by skipping
                                 // unknown directives and "jumping" directly
                                 // from "#ifdef CPU" to this "#else" block
    #endif
     
    // To fix the problem above we may conditionally define the
    // macro ELIFDEF_SUPPORTED only if the C++23 directives
    // #elifdef/#elifndef are supported.
    #if 0
    #elifndef UNDEFINED_MACRO
    #define ELIFDEF_SUPPORTED
    #else
    #endif
     
    #ifdef ELIFDEF_SUPPORTED
        #ifdef CPU
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no1\n";
        #elifdef GPU
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no2\n";
        #elifndef RAM
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: yes\n"; // expected block
        #else
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no3\n";
        #endif
    #else // when #elifdef unsupported use old verbose “#elif defined”
        #ifdef CPU
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no1\n";
        #elif defined GPU
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no2\n";
        #elif !defined RAM
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: yes\n"; // expected block
        #else
            [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << "4: no3\n";
        #endif
    #endif
    }

Possible output: 
    
    
    1: yes
    2: yes
    3: yes
    4: no!
    4: yes
