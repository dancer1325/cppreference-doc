The concept `Boolean<B>` specifies the requirements for a type usable in Boolean contexts. For `Boolean` to be satisfied, the logical operators must have the usual behavior (including short-circuiting). More precisely, given 

  * `b1`, `b2`, two lvalues of type const [std::remove_reference_t](../../../types/remove_reference.html)<B>, 



`Boolean<B>` is satisfied only if: 

  * bool(b1) == !bool(!b1); 
  * b1 && b2, b1 && bool(b2) and bool(b1) && b2 are all equal to bool(b1) && bool(b2) and have the same short-circuit evaluation; 
  * b1 || b2, b1 || bool(b2) and bool(b1) || b2 are all equal to bool(b1) || bool(b2) and have the same short-circuit evaluation; 
  * bool(b1 == b2), bool(b1 == bool(b2)), and bool(bool(b1) == b2) are all equal to (bool(b1) == bool(b2)); 
  * bool(b1 != b2), bool(b1 != bool(b2)), and bool(bool(b1) != b2) are all equal to (bool(b1) != bool(b2)). 



### Equality preservation 

An expression is _equality preserving_ if it results in equal outputs given equal inputs. 

  * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands. 
  * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands modified by the expression (if any). 



Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required to be _stable_ : two evaluations of such an expression with the same input objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening modification of those input objects. 

Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a _requires-expression_ is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that are constant must not be modified. 

### Implicit expression variations 

A _requires-expression_ that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also implicitly requires additional variations of that expression that accept a non-constant lvalue or (possibly constant) rvalue for the given operand unless such an expression variation is explicitly required with differing semantics. These _implicit expression variations_ must meet the same semantic requirements of the declared expression. The extent to which an implementation validates the syntax of the variations is unspecified. 

### Notes

Examples of `Boolean` types include bool, [std::true_type](../../../types/integral_constant.html), and [std::bitset](../../../utility/bitset.html)<N>::reference. Pointers are not `Boolean` types. 

A deduction constraint of the form { expression } -> Same<T>&& effectively requires decltype((expression))&& to be the exact same type as `T&&`. This constrains both the expression's type and its value category.
