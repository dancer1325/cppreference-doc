template< class... T >  
struct common_type; |  |  (ranges TS)

Determines the common type among all types `T...`, that is the type all `T...` can be implicitly converted to. If such a type exists (as determined according to the rules below), the member `type` names that type. Otherwise, there is no member `type`. The behavior is undefined if any of the types in `T...` is an incomplete type other than (possibly cv-qualified) void. 

  * If sizeof...(T) is zero, there is no member `type`. 
  * If sizeof...(T) is one (i.e., `T...` contains only one type `T0`), the member `type` names the same type as [std::decay_t](../../../types/decay.html)<T0>. 
  * If sizeof...(T) is two (i.e., `T...` contains exactly two types `T1` and `T2`), 



    

  * If applying [std::decay](../../../types/decay.html "cpp/types/decay") to at least one of `T1` and `T2` produces a different type, the member `type` names the same type as ranges::common_type_t<[std::decay_t](../../../types/decay.html)<T1>, [std::decay_t](../../../types/decay.html)<T2>>, if it exists; if not, there is no member `type`; 
  * Otherwise, (and unless there is a user specialization for ranges::common_type<T1, T2>), if [std::common_type_t](../../../types/common_type.html)<T1, T2> is well-formed, then the member `type` denotes that type; 
  * Otherwise, the member `type` denotes the type [std::decay_t](../../../types/decay.html)<decltype(false ? [std::declval](../../../utility/declval.html)<const T1&>() : [std::declval](../../../utility/declval.html)<const T2&>())>, if that conditional expression is well-formed; if not, there is no member `type`. 



  * If sizeof...(T) is greater than two (i.e., `T...` consists of the types `T1, T2, R...`), then if ranges::common_type_t<T1, T2> exists, the member `type` denotes ranges::common_type_t<ranges::common_type_t<T1, T2>, R...> if such a type exists. In all other cases, there is no member `type`.

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/experimental/ranges/type_traits/common_type&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Specializations")] Specializations

Users may specialize `common_type` for types `T1` and `T2` if 

  * At least one of `T1` and `T2` depends on a user-defined type, and 
  * [std::decay](../../../types/decay.html "cpp/types/decay") is an identity transformation for both `T1` and `T2`. 



If such a specialization has a member named `type`, it must be a public and unambiguous member type that names a cv-unqualified non-reference type to which both `T1` and `T2` are explicitly convertible. Additionally, ranges::common_type_t<T1, T2> and ranges::common_type_t<T2, T1> must denote the same type. 

A program that adds `common_type` specializations in violation of these rules has undefined behavior. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/experimental/ranges/type_traits/common_type&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

For arithmetic types not subject to promotion, the common type may be viewed as the type of the (possibly mixed-mode) arithmetic expression such as T0() + T1() + ... + Tn().
