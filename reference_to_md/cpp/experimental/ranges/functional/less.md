Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template invokes operator< on const lvalues of type `T`. The specialization `less<void>` deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type). 

All specializations of `less` are [`Semiregular`](../concepts/Semiregular.html "cpp/experimental/ranges/concepts/Semiregular").

##  std::experimental::ranges::less::operator()

constexpr bool operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const; |  (1)  |  (member only of primary `less<T>` template)  
---|---|---  
template< class T, class U >  
requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U> ||  
/* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>() resolves to

| |   
  
1) Compares `x` and `y`. Equivalent to return [ranges::less](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges-functional-placeholder/less)<>{}(x, y);.

2) Compares `t` and `u`. Equivalent to return [std::forward](../../../utility/forward.html)<T>(t) < [std::forward](../../../utility/forward.html)<U>(u);, except when that expression resolves to a call to a builtin operator< comparing pointers.

When a call to (1) or (2) would invoke a built-in operator comparing pointers of type `P`, the result is instead determined as follows: 

  * Returns true if the (possibly converted) value of the first argument precedes the (possibly converted) value of the second argument in the implementation-defined strict total ordering over all pointer values of type `P`. This strict total ordering is consistent with the partial order imposed by the builtin operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. 
  * Otherwise, returns false. 



The behavior is undefined unless the conversion sequences from both `T` and `U` to `P` are equality-preserving (see below). 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Template:cpp/experimental/ranges/equality_preservation&action=edit&section=T-1 "Template:cpp/experimental/ranges/equality preservation")] Equality preservation 

An expression is _equality preserving_ if it results in equal outputs given equal inputs. 

  * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands. 
  * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands modified by the expression (if any). 



Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required to be _stable_ : two evaluations of such an expression with the same input objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening modification of those input objects. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/experimental/ranges/functional/less&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

Unlike [std::less](../../../utility/functional/less.html "cpp/utility/functional/less"), `ranges::less` requires all six comparison operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==` and `!=` to be valid (via the [`StrictTotallyOrdered`](../concepts/StrictTotallyOrdered.html "cpp/experimental/ranges/concepts/StrictTotallyOrdered") and [`StrictTotallyOrderedWith`](../concepts/StrictTotallyOrdered.html "cpp/experimental/ranges/concepts/StrictTotallyOrdered") constraints).
