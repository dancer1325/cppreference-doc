The Execution control library provides a framework for managing asynchronous execution on generic execution resources. 

The library aims to provide vocabulary types for asynchronous operations and to allow the construction of task execution graphs in a simple, composable way.

## Library-wide definitions

  * **Sender** : A description of asynchronous work to be sent for execution. Produces an operation state (below). 



    

  * Senders asynchronously “send” their results to listeners called “receivers” (below). 
  * Senders can be composed into **task graphs** using generic algorithms. 
  * **Sender factories and adaptors** are generic algorithms that capture common async patterns in objects satisfying the sender concept. 



  * **Receiver** : A generalized callback that consumes or “receives” the asynchronous results produced by a sender. 



    

  * Receivers have three different “channels” through which a sender may propagate results: success, failure, and canceled, so-named “value”, “error”, and “stopped”. 
  * Receivers provide an extensible execution environment: a set of key/value pairs that the consumer can use to parameterize the asynchronous operation. 



  * **Operation State** : An object that contains the state needed by the asynchronous operation. 



    

  * A sender and receiver are connected when passed to the std::execution::connect function. 
  * The result of connecting a sender and a receiver is an operation state. 
  * Work is not enqueued for execution until “`start`” is called on an operation state. 
  * Once started, the operation state’s lifetime cannot end before the async operation is complete, and its address must be stable. 



  * **Scheduler** : A lightweight handle to an execution context. 



    

  * An execution context is a source of asynchronous execution such as a thread pool or a GPU stream. 
  * A scheduler is a factory for a sender that completes its receiver from a thread of execution owned by the execution context.

#### Sender factories

A sender factory is a function that returns a sender and whose parameters have types for which the [`sender`](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/execution/sender&action=edit&redlink=1 "cpp/execution/sender \(page does not exist\)") concept is false. 

The following are sender factories:

### Example

A version of this example is available on [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/z/vdxGsxsKd), where it uses [stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec), an experimental reference implementation of std::execution.

Run this code
    
    
    #include <cstdio>
    #include <execution>
    #include <string>
    #include <thread>
    #include <utility>
    using namespace std::literals;
     
    int main()
    {
        std::execution::run_loop loop;
     
        [std::jthread](../thread/jthread.html) worker([&]([std::stop_token](../thread/stop_token.html) st)
        {
            [std::stop_callback](../thread/stop_callback.html) cb{st, [&]{ loop.finish(); }};
            loop.run();
        });
     
        std::execution::sender auto hello = std::execution::just("hello world"s);
        std::execution::sender auto print
            = std::move(hello)
            | std::execution::then([]([std::string](../string/basic_string.html) msg)
            {
                return [std::puts](../io/c/puts.html)(msg.c_str());
            });
     
        std::execution::scheduler auto io_thread = loop.get_scheduler();
        std::execution::sender auto work = std::execution::on(io_thread, std::move(print));
     
        auto [result] = std::this_thread::sync_wait(std::move(work)).value();
     
        return result;
    }

Output: 
    
    
    hello world
