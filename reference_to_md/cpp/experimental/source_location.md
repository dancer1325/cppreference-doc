The `source_location` class represents certain information about the source code, such as file names, line numbers, and function names. Previously, functions that desire to obtain this information about the call site (for logging, testing, or debugging purposes) must use macros so that predefined macros like __LINE__ and __FILE__ are expanded in the context of the caller. The `source_location` class provides a better alternative.

Run this code
    
    
    #include <experimental/source_location>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string_view>
     
    void log(const [std::string_view](../string/basic_string_view.html) message,

    int main()
