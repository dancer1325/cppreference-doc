Constructs new `shared_ptr` from a variety of pointer types that refer to an object to manage. 

For the purposes of the description below, a pointer type `Y*` is said to be compatible with a pointer type `T*` if either `Y*` is convertible to `T*` or `Y` is the array type `U[N]` and `T` is `U cv []` (where cv is some set of cv-qualifiers). 

1,2) Constructs a `shared_ptr` with no managed object, i.e. empty `shared_ptr`.

3-7) Constructs a `shared_ptr` with ptr as the pointer to the managed object. If `T` is an array type `U[N]`, `Y(*)[N]` must be convertible to `T*`. If `T` is an array type `U[]`, `Y(*)[]` must be convertible to `T*`. Otherwise, `Y*` must be convertible to `T*`. Additionally:

3) Uses a [delete-expression](../../language/delete.html "cpp/language/delete") (delete ptr, if `T` is not an array type; delete[] ptr if `T` is an array type) as the deleter. `Y` must be a complete type. That delete expression must be well formed, have well-defined behavior and not throw any exceptions.

4,5) Uses the specified deleter d as the deleter. The expression d(ptr) must be well formed, have well-defined behavior and not throw any exceptions. `Deleter` must be [CopyConstructible](../../named_req/CopyConstructible.html "cpp/named req/CopyConstructible"), and its copy constructor and destructor must not throw exceptions.

6,7) Same as (4,5), but additionally uses a copy of alloc for allocation of data for internal use. `Alloc` must be a [Allocator](../../named_req/Allocator.html "cpp/named req/Allocator"), and its copy constructor and destructor must not throw exceptions.

8) The _aliasing constructor_ : constructs a `shared_ptr` which shares ownership information with r, but holds an unrelated and unmanaged pointer ptr. Even if this `shared_ptr` is the last of the group to go out of scope, it will call the destructor for the object originally managed by r. However, calling `get()` on this will always return a copy of ptr. It is the responsibility of the programmer to make sure that this ptr remains valid as long as this shared_ptr exists, such as in the typical use cases where ptr is a member of the object managed by r or is an alias (e.g., downcast) of r.get().

9) Constructs a `shared_ptr` which shares ownership of the object managed by r. If r manages no object, *this manages no object too. The template overload doesn't participate in overload resolution if `Y*` is not _compatible with_ `T*`.

10) Move-constructs a `shared_ptr` from r. After the construction, *this contains a copy of the previous state of r, r is empty. The template overload doesn't participate in overload resolution if `Y*` is not _compatible with_ `T*`.

11) Constructs a `shared_ptr` which shares ownership of the object managed by r. `Y*` must be _compatible with_ `T*`. Note that r.lock() may be used for the same purpose: the difference is that this constructor throws an exception if the argument is empty, while weak_ptr<T>::lock() constructs an empty `shared_ptr` in that case.

12) Constructs a `shared_ptr` that stores and owns the object formerly owned by r. `Y*` must be convertible to `T*`. After construction, r is empty.

13) Constructs a `shared_ptr` which manages the object currently managed by r. The deleter associated with r is stored for future deletion of the managed object. r manages no object after the call. This overload doesn't participate in overload resolution if `Y*` is not _compatible with_ `T*`.   
If `D` is a reference type, equivalent to shared_ptr(r.release(), [std::ref](../../utility/functional/ref.html)(r.get_deleter()). Otherwise, equivalent to shared_ptr(r.release(), r.get_deleter()).

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/experimental/shared_ptr/shared_ptr&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

When constructing a `shared_ptr` from a raw pointer to an object of a type derived from std::experimental::enable_shared_from_this, the constructors of `shared_ptr` update the private `weak_ptr` member of the std::experimental::enable_shared_from_this base so that future calls to [`shared_from_this()`](../../memory/enable_shared_from_this/shared_from_this.html "cpp/memory/enable shared from this/shared from this") would share ownership with the `shared_ptr` created by this raw pointer constructor. 

The raw pointer overloads assume ownership of the pointed-to object, and so constructing a `shared_ptr` using the raw pointer overload for an object that is already managed by a `shared_ptr` may lead to undefined behavior, even if the object is of a type derived from std::experimental::enable_shared_from_this. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/experimental/shared_ptr/shared_ptr&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Parameters")] Parameters

ptr  |  \-  |  a pointer to an object to manage   
---|---|---  
d  |  \-  |  a deleter to use to destroy the object   
alloc  |  \-  |  an allocator to use for allocations of data for internal use   
r  |  \-  |  another smart pointer to share the ownership to or acquire the ownership from   
  
### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/experimental/shared_ptr/shared_ptr&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Exceptions")] Exceptions

3) [std::bad_alloc](../../memory/new/bad_alloc.html "cpp/memory/new/bad alloc") if required additional memory could not be obtained. May throw implementation-defined exception for other errors. The applicable delete-expression (delete ptr if `T` is not an array type, delete[] ptr otherwise) is called if an exception occurs.

4-7) [std::bad_alloc](../../memory/new/bad_alloc.html "cpp/memory/new/bad alloc") if required additional memory could not be obtained. May throw implementation-defined exception for other errors. d(ptr) is called if an exception occurs.

11) [std::bad_weak_ptr](../../memory/bad_weak_ptr.html "cpp/memory/bad weak ptr") if r.expired() == true. The constructor has no effect in this case.

12) [std::bad_alloc](../../memory/new/bad_alloc.html "cpp/memory/new/bad alloc") if required additional memory could not be obtained. May throw implementation-defined exception for other errors. This constructor has no effect if an exception occurs.

13) If an exception is thrown, the constructor has no effects.
