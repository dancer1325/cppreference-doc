### Definition

A _defaulted comparison operator function_ is a non-template comparison operator function (i.e. `<=>`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`) satisfying all following conditions: 

  * It is a [non-static member](member_functions.html "cpp/language/member functions") or [friend](friend.html "cpp/language/friend") of some class `C`. 
  * It is [defined as defaulted](function.html#Function_definition "cpp/language/function") in `C` or in a context where `C` is [complete](type-id.html#Incomplete_type "cpp/language/type"). 
  * It has two parameters of type const C& or two parameters of type `C`, where the [implicit object parameter](overload_resolution.html#Additional_rules_for_member_function_candidates "cpp/language/overload resolution") (if any) is considered to be the first parameter. 



Such a comparison operator function is termed a _defaulted comparison operator function for class`C`_. 
    
    
    struct X
    {
        bool operator==(const X&) const = default; // OK
        bool operator==(const X&) = default;       // Error: the implicit object
                                                   //        parameter type is X&
        bool operator==(this X, X) = default;      // OK
    };
     
    struct Y
    {
        friend bool operator==(Y, Y) = default;        // OK
        friend bool operator==(Y, const Y&) = default; // Error: different parameter types
    };
     
    bool operator==(const Y&, const Y&) = default;     // Error: not a friend of Y

Name lookups and access checks in the implicit definition of a comparison operator function are performed from a context equivalent to its function body. A definition of a comparison operator function as defaulted that appears in a class must be the first declaration of that function. 

### Default comparison order

Given a class `C`, a subobject list is formed by the following subjects in order: 

  * The direct base class subobjects of `C`, in declaration order. 
  * The non-static [data members](data_members.html "cpp/language/data members") of `C`, in declaration order. 



    

  * If any member subobject is of array type, it is expanded to the sequence of its elements, in the order of increasing subscript. The expansion is recursive: array elements of array types will be expanded again until there is no subobject of array type. 



For any object x of type `C`, in the following descriptions: 

  * Let n be the number of subobjects in the (expanded) subobject list for x. 
  * Let x_i be the ith subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for x, where x_i is formed by a sequence of [derived-to-base conversions](overload_resolution.html#Ranking_of_implicit_conversion_sequences "cpp/language/overload resolution"), [class member access expressions](operator_member_access.html#Built-in_member_access_operators "cpp/language/operator member access"), and [array subscript expressions](operator_member_access.html#Built-in_subscript_operator "cpp/language/operator member access") applied to x. 


    
    
    struct S {};
     
    struct T : S
    {
        int arr[2][2];
    } t;
     
    // The subobject list for “t” consists of the following 5 subobjects in order:
    // (S)t → t[0][0] → t[0][1] → t[1][0] → t[1][1]

### Three-way comparison

An operator<=> for a class type can be defined as defaulted with any return type. 

#### Comparison category types

There are three comparison category types: 

  * [`std::strong_ordering`](../utility/compare/strong_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/strong ordering")
  * [`std::weak_ordering`](../utility/compare/weak_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/weak ordering")
  * [`std::partial_ordering`](../utility/compare/partial_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/partial ordering")

Type  |  Equivalent values are..  |  Incomparable values are..   
---|---|---  
[`std::strong_ordering`](../utility/compare/strong_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/strong ordering") | indistinguishable  | not allowed   
[`std::weak_ordering`](../utility/compare/weak_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/weak ordering") | distinguishable  | not allowed   
[`std::partial_ordering`](../utility/compare/partial_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/partial ordering") | distinguishable  | allowed   
  
#### Synthesized three-way comparison

The _synthesized three-way comparison_ of type `T` between glvalues a and b of the same type is defined as follows: 

  * If the overload resolution for a <=> b results in a usable candidate, and can be explicitly converted to `T` using [`static_cast`](static_cast.html "cpp/language/static cast"), the synthesized comparison is static_cast<T>(a <=> b). 
  * Otherwise, if any of the following condition is satisfied, the synthesized comparison is not defined: 



    

  * The overload resolution for a <=> b finds at least one viable candidate. 
  * `T` is not a comparison category type. 
  * The overload resolution for a == b does not result in a usable candidate. 
  * The overload resolution for a < b does not result in a usable candidate. 



  * Otherwise, if `T` is [`std::strong_ordering`](../utility/compare/strong_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/strong ordering"), the synthesized comparison is 


    
    
    a == b ? std::strong_ordering::equal :
    a < b  ? std::strong_ordering::less :
             std::strong_ordering::greater

  * Otherwise, if `T` is [`std::weak_ordering`](../utility/compare/weak_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/weak ordering"), the synthesized comparison is 


    
    
    a == b ? std::weak_ordering::equivalent :
    a < b  ? std::weak_ordering::less :
             std::weak_ordering::greater

  * Otherwise (`T` is [`std::partial_ordering`](../utility/compare/partial_ordering.html "cpp/utility/compare/partial ordering")), the synthesized comparison is 


    
    
    a == b ? std::partial_ordering::equivalent :
    a < b  ? std::partial_ordering::less :
    b < a  ? std::partial_ordering::greater : 
             std::partial_ordering::unordered

#### Placeholder return type

If the declared return type of a defaulted three-way comparison operator function (operator<=>) for a class type `C` is auto, the return type is deduced from the return types of the three-way comparisons between the corresponding subobjects of an object x of type `C`. 

For each subobject x_i in the [(expanded) subobject list](default_comparisons.html#Default_comparison_order) for x: 

  1. Perform overload resolution for x_i <=> x_i, if the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted operator<=> is defined as deleted. 
  2. Denote the cv-unqualified version of the type of x_i <=> x_i as `R_i`, if `R_i` is not a comparison category type, the defaulted operator<=> is defined as deleted. 



If the defaulted operator<=> is not defined as deleted, its return type is deduced as [std::common_comparison_category_t](../utility/compare/common_comparison_category.html)<R_1, R_2, ..., R_n>. 

#### Non-placeholder return type

If the declared return type of the defaulted operator<=> is not auto, it cannot contain any [placeholder type](auto.html "cpp/language/auto") (e.g. decltype(auto)). 

If there is a subobject x_i in the (expanded) subobject list for x such that the [synthesized three-way comparison](default_comparisons.html#Synthesized_three-way_comparison) of the declared return type between x_i and x_i is not defined, the defaulted operator<=> is defined as deleted. 

#### Comparison result

Let x and y be the parameters of a defaulted operator<=>, denote each subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for x and y as x_i and y_i respectively. The default three-way comparison between x and y is performed by comparing corresponding subobjects x_i and y_i with increasing i order. 

Let `R` be the (possibly-deduced) return type, the comparison result between x_i and y_i is the result of the synthesized three-way comparison of type `R` between x_i and y_i. 

  * During the default three-way comparison between x and y, if a subobject-wise comparison between x_i and y_i generates a result v_i such that contextually converting v_i != 0 to bool yields true, the return value is a copy of v_i (the remaining subobjects will not be compared). 
  * Otherwise, the return value is static_cast<R>(std::strong_ordering::equal). 



Run this code
    
    
    #include <compare>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <set>
     
    struct Point
    {
        int x;
        int y;
        auto operator<=>(const Point&) const = default;
        /* non-comparison functions */
    };
     
    int main()
    {
        Point pt1{1, 1}, pt2{1, 2};
        [std::set](../container/set.html)<Point> s; // OK
        s.insert(pt1);     // OK
     
        // two-way comparison operator functions are not required to be explicitly defined:
        // operator== is implicitly declared (see below)
        // the overload resolutions of other candidates will select rewritten candidates 
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << [std::boolalpha](../io/manip/boolalpha.html)
            << (pt1 == pt2) << ' '  // false
            << (pt1 != pt2) << ' '  // true
            << (pt1 <  pt2) << ' '  // true
            << (pt1 <= pt2) << ' '  // true
            << (pt1 >  pt2) << ' '  // false
            << (pt1 >= pt2) << ' '; // false
    }

### Equality comparison

#### Explicit declaration

An operator== for a class type can be defined as defaulted with return type bool. 

Given a class `C` and an object x of type `C`, if there is a subobject x_i in the (expanded) subobject list for x such that the overload resolution for x_i == x_i does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted operator== is defined as deleted. 

Let x and y be the parameters of a defaulted operator==, denote each subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for x and y as x_i and y_i respectively. The default equality comparison between x and y is performed by comparing corresponding subobjects x_i and y_i with increasing i order. 

The comparison result between x_i and y_i is the result of x_i == y_i. 

  * During the default equality comparison between x and y, if a subobject-wise comparison between x_i and y_i generates a result v_i such that contextually converting v_i to bool yields false, the return value is false (the remaining subobjects will not be compared). 
  * Otherwise, the return value is true. 



Run this code
    
    
    #include <iostream>
     
    struct Point
    {
        int x;
        int y;
        bool operator==(const Point&) const = default;
        /* non-comparison functions */
    };
     
    int main()
    {
        Point pt1{3, 5}, pt2{2, 5};
        [std::cout](../io/cout.html) << [std::boolalpha](../io/manip/boolalpha.html)
            << (pt1 != pt2) << '\n'  // true
            << (pt1 == pt1) << '\n'; // true
     
        struct [[maybe_unused]] { int x{}, y{}; } p, q;
        // if (p == q) {} // Error: operator== is not defined
    }

#### Implicit declaration

If a class `C` does not explicitly declare any member or friend named operator==, an `==` operator function is declared implicitly for each operator<=> defined as defaulted. Each implicity-declared operator== have the same access and [function definition](function.html#Function_definition "cpp/language/function") and in the same [class scope](scope.html#Class_scope "cpp/language/scope") as the respective defaulted operator<=>, with the following changes: 

  * The [declarator identifier](declarations.html#Declarators "cpp/language/declarations") is replaced with operator==. 
  * The return type is replaced with bool. 


    
    
    template<typename T>
    struct X
    {
        friend constexpr [std::partial_ordering](../utility/compare/partial_ordering.html) operator<=>(X, X)
            requires (sizeof(T) != 1) = default;
        // implicitly declares: friend constexpr bool operator==(X, X)
        //                          requires (sizeof(T) != 1) = default;
     
        [[nodiscard]] virtual [std::strong_ordering](../utility/compare/strong_ordering.html) operator<=>(const X&) const = default;
        // implicitly declares: [[nodiscard]] virtual bool
        //                          operator==(const X&) const = default;
    };

### Secondary comparison

A secondary comparison operator function (`!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`) for a class type can be defined as defaulted with return type bool. 

Let `@` be one of the five secondary comparison operators, for each defaulted operator@ with parameters x and y, up to two overloads resolutions are performed (not considering the defaulted operator@ as a candidate) to determine whether it is defined as deleted. 

  * The first overload resolution is performed for x @ y. If the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, or the selected candidate is not a [rewritten candidate](overload_resolution.html#Call_to_an_overloaded_operator "cpp/language/overload resolution"), the defaulted operator@ is defined as deleted. There is no second overload resolution in these cases. 
  * The second overload resolution is performed for the selected rewritten candidate of x @ y. If the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted operator@ is defined as deleted. 



If is x @ y cannot be implicitly converted to bool, the defaulted operator@ is defined as deleted. 

If the defaulted operator@ is not defined as deleted, it yields x @ y. 
    
    
    struct HasNoRelational {};
     
    struct C
    {
        friend HasNoRelational operator<=>(const C&, const C&);
        bool operator<(const C&) const = default; // OK, function is defaulted
    };
