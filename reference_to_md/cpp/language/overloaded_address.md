Besides [function-call expressions](operator_other.html "cpp/language/operator other"), where [overload resolution](overload_resolution.html "cpp/language/overload resolution") takes place, the name of an overloaded function may appear in the following 7 contexts: 

#  | Context  | Target   
---|---|---  
1  | [initializer](initialization.html "cpp/language/initialization") in a [declaration](declarations.html "cpp/language/declarations") of an object or [reference](reference_initialization.html "cpp/language/reference initialization") | the object or reference being initialized   
2  | on the right-hand-side of an built-in assignment expression  | the left-hand side of the built-in assignment   
3  | as a function call argument  | the function parameter   
4  | as a user-defined operator argument  | the operator parameter   
5  | the [`return`](return.html "cpp/language/return") statement  | the return value of a function or conversion   
6  | [explicit cast](explicit_cast.html "cpp/language/explicit cast") or [`static_cast`](static_cast.html "cpp/language/static cast") argument  | the corresponding cast   
7  | constant [template argument](template_parameters.html "cpp/language/template parameters") | the corresponding template parameter   
  
In each context, the name of an overloaded function may be preceded by address-of operator `**&**` and may be enclosed in a redundant set of parentheses. 

If the target type contains a [placeholder type](auto.html "cpp/language/auto"), placeholder type deduction is performed, and the following description uses the deduced type as target type.  | (since C++26)

### Selecting functions

When the address of an overloaded function is taken, a set `S` of functions is selected from the overload set referred to by the name of the overload function: 

  * If there is no target, all non-template functions named are selected. 
  * Otherwise, a non-template function with type `F` is selected for the function type `FT` of the target type if `F` (after possibly applying the [function pointer conversion](implicit_cast.html#Function_pointer_conversions "cpp/language/implicit conversion"))(since C++17) is identical to `FT`.[[1]](overloaded_address.html#cite_note-1)
  * The specialization (if any) generated by [template argument deduction](template_argument_deduction.html "cpp/language/template argument deduction") for each function template named is also added to `S`. 



If the target is of function pointer type or reference to function type, `S` can only include non-member functions, explicit object member functions(since C++23) and static member functions. If the target is of pointer-to-member-function type, `S` can only include implicit object member functions. 

  1. [↑](overloaded_address.html#cite_ref-1) In other words, the class of which the function is a member is ignored if the target type is a pointer-to-member-function type.



### Eliminating functions

After forming the set `S`, functions are elimiated in the following order: 

  * All functions with associated [constraints](constraints.html#Constraints "cpp/language/constraints") that are not satisfied are eliminated from the `S`. 

| (since C++20)  
---|---  
  
  * If more than one function in `S` remains, all function template specializations in `S` are eliminated if `S` also contains a non-template function. 



  * Any given non-template function func is eliminated if `S` contains a second non-template function that is [more partial-ordering-constrained](constraints.html#Partial_ordering_of_constraints "cpp/language/constraints") than func. 

| (since C++20)  
---|---  
  
  * Any given function template specialization spec is eliminated if `S` contains a second function template specialization whose function template is [more specialized](function_template.html#Function_template_overloading "cpp/language/function template") than the function template of spec. 



After such eliminations (if any), exactly one selected function should remain in `S`. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed. 

### Example

Run this code
    
    
    int f(int) { return 1; }
    int f(double) { return 2; }
     
    void g(int(&f1)(int), int(*f2)(double)) { f1(0); f2(0.0); }
     
    template<int(*F)(int)>
    struct Templ {};
     
    struct Foo
    {
        int mf(int) { return 3; }
        int mf(double) { return 4; }
    };
     
    struct Emp
    {
        void operator<<(int (*)(double)) {}
    };
     
    int main()
    {
        // 1. initialization
        int (*pf)(double) = f; // selects int f(double)
        int (&rf)(int) = f; // selects int f(int)
        int (Foo::*mpf)(int) = &Foo::mf; // selects int mf(int)
     
        // 2. assignment
        pf = nullptr;
        pf = &f; // selects int f(double)
     
        // 3. function argument
        g(f, f); // selects int f(int) for the 1st argument
                 // and int f(double) for the second
     
        // 4. user-defined operator
        Emp{} << f; //selects int f(double)
     
        // 5. return value
        auto foo = []() -> int (*)(int)
        {
            return f; // selects int f(int)
        };
     
        // 6. cast
        auto p = static_cast<int(*)(int)>(f); // selects int f(int)
     
        // 7. template argument
        Templ<f> t;  // selects int f(int)
     
        // prevent “unused variable” warnings as if by [[maybe_unused]]
        [](...){}(pf, rf, mpf, foo, p, t);
    }
