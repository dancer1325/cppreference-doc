### Explanation

1) Ordinary character literal, e.g. 'a' or '\n' or '\13'. Such literal has type char and the value equal to the representation of c-char in the [execution character set](charset.html#Execution_character_set_.28Old_definition.29 "cpp/language/charset")(until C++23)the corresponding code point from [ordinary literal encoding](charset.html#Code_unit_and_literal_encoding "cpp/language/charset")(since C++23).

2) UTF-8 character literal, e.g. u8'a'. Such literal has type char(until C++20)char8_t(since C++20) and the value equal to [ISO/IEC 10646](https://www.iso.org/standard/76835.html) code point value of c-char, provided that the code point value is representable with a single UTF-8 code unit (that is, c-char is in the range 0x0-0x7F, inclusive).

3) UTF-16 character literal, e.g. u'猫', but not u'🍌' (u'\U0001f34c'). Such literal has type char16_t and the value equal to [ISO/IEC 10646](https://www.iso.org/standard/76835.html) code point value of c-char, provided that the code point value is representable with a single UTF-16 code unit (that is, c-char is in the range 0x0-0xFFFF, inclusive).

4) UTF-32 character literal, e.g. U'猫' or U'🍌'. Such literal has type char32_t and the value equal to [ISO/IEC 10646](https://www.iso.org/standard/76835.html) code point value of c-char.

5) Wide character literal, e.g. L'β' or L'猫'. Such literal has type wchar_t and the value equal to the value of c-char in the execution wide character set(until C++23)the corresponding code point from wide literal encoding(since C++23).

6) Ordinary multicharacter literal(until C++23)Multicharacter literal(since C++23), e.g. 'AB', is conditionally-supported, has type int and implementation-defined value.

7) Wide multicharacter literal, e.g. L'AB', is conditionally-supported, has type wchar_t and implementation-defined value.

#### Non-encodable characters

1-5) Given that c-char is not a numeric escape sequence (see below), if c-char is not representable in the literal’s associated character encoding or cannot be encoded as a single code unit in that encoding (e.g. a non-BMP value on Windows where wchar_t is 16-bit), the program is ill-formed.

6) If any c-char in c-char-sequence cannot be encoded as a single code unit in [ordinary literal encoding](charset.html#Code_unit_and_literal_encoding "cpp/language/charset"), the program is ill-formed.

7) If any c-char in c-char-sequence cannot be encoded as a single code unit in [wide literal encoding](charset.html#Code_unit_and_literal_encoding "cpp/language/charset"), the program is ill-formed. | (until C++23)  
---|---  
  
#### Numeric escape sequences

Numeric (octal and hexadecimal) escape sequences can be used for specifying the value of the character. 

If the character literal contains only one numeric escape sequence, and the value specified by the escape sequence is representable by the unsigned version of its type, the character literal has the same value as the specified value (possibly after conversion to the character type). A UTF-_N_ character literal can have any value representable by its type. If the value does not correspond to a valid Unicode code point, or if the its corresponding code point is not representable as single code unit in UTF-_N_ , it can still be specified by a numeric escape sequence with the value. E.g. u8'\xff' is well-formed and equal to char8_t(0xFF).  | (since C++23)  
---|---  
  
If the value specified by a numeric escape sequence used in an ordinary or wide character literal is not representable by char or wchar_t respectively, the value of the character literal is implementation-defined.  | (until C++23)  
---|---  
If the value specified by a numeric escape sequence used in an ordinary or wide character literal with one c-char is representable by the unsigned version of the underlying type of char or wchar_t respectively, the value of the literal is the integer value of that unsigned integer type and the specified value converted to the type of the literal. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.  | (since C++23)  
  
If the value specified by a numeric escape sequence used in a UTF-_N_ character literal is not representable by the corresponding `char _N_ _t`, the value of the character literal is implementation-defined(until C++17)the program is ill-formed(since C++17).  | (since C++11)  
---|---  
  
### Notes

Multicharacter literals were inherited by C from the B programming language. Although not specified by the C or C++ standard, most compilers (MSVC is a notable exception) implement multicharacter literals as specified in B: the values of each char in the literal initialize successive bytes of the resulting integer, in big-endian zero-padded right-adjusted order, e.g. the value of '\1' is 0x00000001 and the value of '\1\2\3\4' is 0x01020304. 

In C, character constants such as 'a' or '\n' have type int, rather than char.
