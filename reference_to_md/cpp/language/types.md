### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: void")] void

    void — type with an empty set of values. It is an [incomplete type](incomplete_type.html "cpp/language/incomplete type") that cannot be completed (consequently, objects of type void are disallowed). There are no [arrays](array.html "cpp/language/array") of void, nor [references](reference.html "cpp/language/reference") to void. However, [pointers to void](pointer.html#Pointers_to_void "cpp/language/pointer") and [functions](function.html "cpp/language/function") returning type void (_procedures_ in other languages) are permitted. 

###  [std::nullptr_t](../types/nullptr_t.html "cpp/types/nullptr t")

|  Defined in header `[<cstddef>](../header/cstddef.html "cpp/header/cstddef")` |  |   
---|---|---  
typedef decltype(nullptr) nullptr_t; |  |  (since C++11)  
| |   
  
[std::nullptr_t](../types/nullptr_t.html "cpp/types/nullptr t") is the type of the null pointer literal, [`nullptr`](nullptr.html "cpp/language/nullptr"). It is a distinct type that is not itself a pointer type or a pointer to member type. All Its prvalues are [null pointer constants](pointer.html#Null_pointers "cpp/language/pointer"). 

sizeof([std::nullptr_t](../types/nullptr_t.html)) is equal to sizeof(void*). 

(since C++11)

#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Standard integer types")] Standard integer types

    int — basic integer type. The keyword int may be omitted if any of the modifiers listed below are used. If no length modifiers are present, it's guaranteed to have a width of at least 16 bits. However, on 32/64 bit systems it is almost exclusively guaranteed to have width of at least 32 bits (see below). 

##### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Modifiers")] Modifiers

Modifies the basic integer type. Can be mixed in any order. Only one of each group can be present in type name. 

  * Signedness: 



    signed — target type will have signed representation (this is the default if omitted) 
    unsigned — target type will have unsigned representation 

  * Size: 



    short — target type will be optimized for space and will have width of at least 16 bits. 
    long — target type will have width of at least 32 bits. 

    long long — target type will have width of at least 64 bits. 
| (since C++11)  
---|---  
  
Note: as with all type specifiers, any order is permitted: unsigned long long int and long int unsigned long name the same type. 

##### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Properties")] Properties

The following table summarizes all available standard integer types and their properties in various common data models: 

Type specifier  | Equivalent type  | Width in bits by [data model](types.html#Data_models)  
---|---|---  
C++ standard  |  LP32  |  ILP32  |  LLP64  |  LP64   
signed char | signed char | at least  
**8** | **8** | **8** | **8** | **8**

long long int  
signed long long  
signed long long int  
unsigned long long | unsigned long long int  
(C++11)  
unsigned long long int  
  
Note: integer arithmetic is defined differently for the signed and unsigned integer types. See [arithmetic operators](operator_arithmetic.html "cpp/language/operator arithmetic"), in particular [integer overflows](operator_arithmetic.html#Overflows "cpp/language/operator arithmetic"). 

[std::size_t](../types/size_t.html "cpp/types/size t") is the unsigned integer type of the result of the [`sizeof`](sizeof.html "cpp/language/sizeof") operator as well as the [`sizeof...`](sizeof....html "cpp/language/sizeof...") operator and the [`alignof`](alignof.html "cpp/language/alignof") operator(since C++11). 

####  Extended integer types

The extended integer types are implementation-defined. Note that [fixed width integer types](../types/integer.html "cpp/types/integer") are typically aliases of the standard integer types.  | (since C++11)  
---|---  
  
#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Boolean type")] Boolean type

    bool — integer type, capable of holding one of the two values: [`true`](bool_literal.html "cpp/language/bool literal") or [`false`](bool_literal.html "cpp/language/bool literal"). The value of sizeof(bool) is implementation defined and might differ from 1. 

#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Character types")] Character types

Character types are integer types used for a character representation. 

    signed char — type for signed character representation. 
    unsigned char — type for unsigned character representation. Also used to inspect [object representations](objects.html "cpp/language/object") (raw memory). 
    char — type for character representation which can be most efficiently processed on the target system (has the same representation and alignment as either signed char or unsigned char, but is always a distinct type). [Multibyte characters strings](../string/multibyte.html "cpp/string/multibyte") use this type to represent code units. For every value of type unsigned char in range `[`​0​`, `255`]`, converting the value to char and then back to unsigned char produces the original value.(since C++11) The signedness of char depends on the compiler and the target platform: the defaults for ARM and PowerPC are typically unsigned, the defaults for x86 and x64 are typically signed. 
    wchar_t — type for wide character representation (see [wide strings](../string/wide.html "cpp/string/wide")). It has the same size, signedness, and alignment as one of the integer types, but is a distinct type. In practice, it is 32 bits and holds UTF-32 on Linux and many other non-Windows systems, but 16 bits and holds UTF-16 code units on Windows. The standard used to require wchar_t to be large enough to represent any supported character code point. However, such requirement cannot be fulfilled on Windows, and thus it is considered as a [defect](types.html#Defect_reports) and removed. 

    char16_t — type for UTF-16 character representation, required to be large enough to represent any UTF-16 code unit (16 bits). It has the same size, signedness, and alignment as [std::uint_least16_t](../types/integer.html "cpp/types/integer"), but is a distinct type. 

    char32_t — type for UTF-32 character representation, required to be large enough to represent any UTF-32 code unit (32 bits). It has the same size, signedness, and alignment as [std::uint_least32_t](../types/integer.html "cpp/types/integer"), but is a distinct type. 
| (since C++11)  
---|---  
  
    char8_t — type for UTF-8 character representation, required to be large enough to represent any UTF-8 code unit (8 bits). It has the same size, signedness, and alignment as unsigned char (and therefore, the same size and alignment as char and signed char), but is a distinct type. 
| (since C++20)  
---|---  
  
Besides the minimal bit counts, the C++ Standard guarantees that 

    1 == sizeof(char) `≤` sizeof(short) `≤` sizeof(int) `≤` sizeof(long) `≤` sizeof(long long). 

Note: this allows the extreme case in which [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "enwiki:Byte") are sized 64 bits, all types (including char) are 64 bits wide, and [`sizeof`](sizeof.html "cpp/language/sizeof") returns 1 for every type. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Floating-point types")] Floating-point types

#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Standard floating-point types")] Standard floating-point types

The following three types and their cv-qualified versions are collectively called standard floating-point types. 

    float — single precision floating-point type. Usually [IEEE-754 binary32 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format "enwiki:Single-precision floating-point format"). 
    double — double precision floating-point type. Usually [IEEE-754 binary64 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format "enwiki:Double-precision floating-point format"). 
    long double — extended precision floating-point type. Does not necessarily map to types mandated by IEEE-754. 

  * [IEEE-754 binary128 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format "enwiki:Quadruple-precision floating-point format") is used by some HP-UX, SPARC, MIPS, ARM64, and z/OS implementations. 
  * The most well known [IEEE-754 binary64-extended format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision "enwiki:Extended precision") is [x87 80-bit extended precision format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision#x86_extended_precision_format "enwiki:Extended precision"). It is used by many x86 and x86-64 implementations (a notable exception is MSVC, which implements long double in the same format as double, i.e. binary64). 
  * On PowerPC [double-double](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format#Double-double_arithmetic "enwiki:Quadruple-precision floating-point format") can be used. 



####  Extended floating-point types

The extended floating-point types are implementation-defined. They may include [fixed width floating-point types](../types/floating-point.html "cpp/types/floating-point").  | (since C++23)  
---|---  
  
#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Properties")] Properties

Floating-point types may support [special values](../types/numeric_limits.html "cpp/types/numeric limits"): 

  * _infinity_ (positive and negative), see [INFINITY](../numeric/math/INFINITY.html "cpp/numeric/math/INFINITY")
  * the _negative zero_ , -0.0. It compares equal to the positive zero, but is meaningful in some arithmetic operations, e.g. 1.0 / 0.0 == [INFINITY](../numeric/math/INFINITY.html), but 1.0 / -0.0 == -[INFINITY](../numeric/math/INFINITY.html)), and for some mathematical functions, e.g. [`sqrt(std::complex)`](../numeric/complex/sqrt.html "cpp/numeric/complex/sqrt")
  * _not-a-number_ (NaN), which does not compare equal with anything (including itself). Multiple bit patterns represent NaNs, see [std::nan](../numeric/math/nan.html "cpp/numeric/math/nan"), [NAN](../numeric/math/NAN.html "cpp/numeric/math/NAN"). Note that C++ takes no special notice of signalling NaNs other than detecting their support by [std::numeric_limits::has_signaling_NaN](../types/numeric_limits/has_signaling_NaN.html "cpp/types/numeric limits/has signaling NaN"), and treats all NaNs as quiet. 



Floating-point numbers may be used with [arithmetic operators](operator_arithmetic.html "cpp/language/operator arithmetic") +, -, /, and * as well as various mathematical functions from [`<cmath>`](../header/cmath.html "cpp/header/cmath"). Both built-in operators and library functions may raise floating-point exceptions and set [errno](../error/errno.html "cpp/error/errno") as described in [`math errhandling`](../numeric/math/math_errhandling.html "cpp/numeric/math/math errhandling"). 

Floating-point expressions may have greater range and precision than indicated by their types, see [FLT_EVAL_METHOD](../types/climits/FLT_EVAL_METHOD.html "cpp/types/climits/FLT EVAL METHOD"). Floating-point expressions may also be _contracted_ , that is, calculated as if all intermediate values have infinite range and precision, see [` #pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT`](../preprocessor/impl.html#.23pragma_STDC "cpp/preprocessor/impl"). Standard C++ does not restrict the accuracy of floating-point operations. 

Some operations on floating-point numbers are affected by and modify the state of [the floating-point environment](../numeric/fenv.html "cpp/numeric/fenv") (most notably, the rounding direction). 

[Implicit conversions](implicit_cast.html "cpp/language/implicit conversion") are defined between floating types and integer types. 

See [limits of floating-point types](../types/climits.html#Limits_of_floating-point_types "cpp/types/climits") and [std::numeric_limits](../types/numeric_limits.html "cpp/types/numeric limits") for additional details, limits, and properties of the floating-point types. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Range of values")] Range of values

The following table provides a reference for the limits of common numeric representations. 

Prior to C++20, the C++ Standard allowed any signed integer representation, and the minimum guaranteed range of N-bit signed integers was from \\(\scriptsize -(2^{N-1}-1)\\)-(2N-1  
-1) to \\(\scriptsize +2^{N-1}-1\\)+2N-1  
-1 (e.g. **−127** to **127** for a signed 8-bit type), which corresponds to the limits of [ones' complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement "enwiki:Ones' complement") or [sign-and-magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations#Sign-and-magnitude_method "enwiki:Signed number representations"). 

However, all C++ compilers use [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement "enwiki:Two's complement") representation, and as of C++20, it is the only representation allowed by the standard, with the guaranteed range from \\(\scriptsize -2^{N-1}\\)-2N-1  
to \\(\scriptsize +2^{N-1}-1\\)+2N-1  
-1 (e.g. **−128** to **127** for a signed 8-bit type). 

8-bit ones' complement and sign-and-magnitude representations for char have been disallowed since C++11 (via the resolution of [CWG issue 1759](https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/1759.html)), because a UTF-8 code unit of value 0x80 used in a [UTF-8 string literal](string_literal.html "cpp/language/string literal") must be storable in a char type object. 

The range for a floating-point type `T` is defined as follows: 

  * The minimum guaranteed range is the most negative finite floating-point number representable in `T` through the most positive finite floating-point number representable in `T`. 
  * If negative infinity is representable in `T`, the range of `T` is extended to all negative real numbers. 
  * If positive infinity is representable in `T`, the range of `T` is extended to all positive real numbers. 



Since negative and positive infinity are representable in [ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559](https://www.iso.org/standard/80985.html) formats, all real numbers lie within the range of representable values of a floating-point type adhering to ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559.

  1. [↑](types.html#cite_ref-1) The object representation usually occupies 96/128 bits on 32/64-bit platforms respectively.



Note: actual (as opposed to guaranteed minimal) limits on the values representable by these types are available in [C numeric limits interface](../types/climits.html "cpp/types/climits") and [std::numeric_limits](../types/numeric_limits.html "cpp/types/numeric limits"). 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/types&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Data models")] Data models

The choices made by each implementation about the sizes of the fundamental types are collectively known as _data model_. Four data models found wide acceptance: 

32 bit systems: 

    

  * **LP32** or **2/4/4** (int is 16-bit, long and pointer are 32-bit) 



    

  * Win16 API 



  * **ILP32** or **4/4/4** (int, long, and pointer are 32-bit); 



    

  * Win32 API 
  * Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) 



64 bit systems: 

    

  * **LLP64** or **4/4/8** (int and long are 32-bit, pointer is 64-bit) 



    

  * [Win32 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/desktop-programming) (also called the Windows API) with compilation target [64-bit ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64 "enwiki:AArch64") (AArch64) or [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x86-64 "enwiki:x86-64") (a.k.a. x64) 



  * **LP64** or **4/8/8** (int is 32-bit, long and pointer are 64-bit) 



    

  * Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) 



Other models are very rare. For example, **ILP64** (**8/8/8** : int, long, and pointer are 64-bit) only appeared in some early 64-bit Unix systems (e.g. [UNICOS on Cray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICOS "enwiki:UNICOS")).
