1,2) Performs character input operations.

1) Behaves as a [FormattedInputFunction](../../named_req/FormattedInputFunction.html "cpp/named req/FormattedInputFunction"). After constructing and checking the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts a character and stores it to `ch`. If no character is available, sets [`failbit`](../ios_base/iostate.html "cpp/io/ios base/iostate") (in addition to [`eofbit`](../ios_base/iostate.html "cpp/io/ios base/iostate") that is set as required of a [FormattedInputFunction](../../named_req/FormattedInputFunction.html "cpp/named req/FormattedInputFunction")).

2) Behaves as a [FormattedInputFunction](../../named_req/FormattedInputFunction.html "cpp/named req/FormattedInputFunction"). After constructing and checking the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts successive characters and stores them at successive locations of a character array whose first element is pointed to by(until C++20) `s`. The extraction stops if any of the following conditions is met: 

  * A whitespace character (as determined by the [`ctype<CharT>`](../../locale/ctype.html "cpp/locale/ctype") facet) is found. The whitespace character is not extracted. 



  * If st.width() is greater than zero, st.width() - 1 characters are stored. 

| (until C++20)  
---|---  
  
  * n - 1 characters are stored, where n is defined as follows: 



    

  * If st.width() is greater than zero, [std::min](../../algorithm/min.html)([std::size_t](../../types/size_t.html)(st.width()), N); 
  * otherwise, n is N. 


| (since C++20)  
  
  * End of file occurs in the input sequence (this also sets [`eofbit`](../ios_base/iostate.html "cpp/io/ios base/iostate")). 

In either case, an additional null character value CharT() is stored at the end of the output. If no characters were extracted, sets [`failbit`](../ios_base/iostate.html "cpp/io/ios base/iostate") (the null character is still written, to the first position in the output). Finally, calls st.width(0) to cancel the effects of [std::setw](../manip/setw.html "cpp/io/manip/setw"), if any.

3) Calls the appropriate extraction operator, given an rvalue reference to an input stream object (equivalent to st >> [std::forward](../../utility/forward.html)<T>(value)). This overload participates in overload resolution only if st >> [std::forward](../../utility/forward.html)<T>(value) is well-formed and `Istream` is a class type publicly and unambiguously derived from [std::ios_base](../ios_base.html "cpp/io/ios base").

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt2&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

Extracting a single character that is the last character of the stream does not set `eofbit`: this is different from other formatted input functions, such as extracting the last integer with operator>>, but this behavior matches the behavior of [std::scanf](../c/scanf.html "cpp/io/c/fscanf") with "%c" format specifier.

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt2&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Example")] Example

Run this code
    
    
    #include <iomanip>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <sstream>
     
    int main()
    {
        [std::string](../../string/basic_string.html) input = "n greetings";
        [std::istringstream](../basic_istringstream.html) stream(input);
     
        char c;
        const int MAX = 6;
        char cstr[MAX];
     
        stream >> c >> [std::setw](../manip/setw.html)(MAX) >> cstr;
        [std::cout](../cout.html) << "c = " << c << '\n'
                  << "cstr = " << cstr << '\n';
     
        double f;
