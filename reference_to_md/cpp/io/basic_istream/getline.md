basic_istream& getline( char_type* s, [std::streamsize](../streamsize.html) count ); |  (1)  |   
---|---|---  
basic_istream& getline( char_type* s, [std::streamsize](../streamsize.html) count, char_type delim ); |  (2)  |   
| |   
  
Extracts characters from stream until end of line or the specified delimiter delim. 

The first overload is equivalent to getline(s, count, widen('\n')). 

Behaves as [UnformattedInputFunction](../../named_req/UnformattedInputFunction.html "cpp/named req/UnformattedInputFunction"). After constructing and checking the sentry object, extracts characters from *this and stores them in successive locations of the array whose first element is pointed to by s, until any of the following occurs (tested in the order shown): 

  1. end of file condition occurs in the input sequence. 
  2. the next available character c is the delimiter, as determined by Traits::eq(c, delim). The delimiter is extracted (unlike [`basic_istream::get()`](get.html "cpp/io/basic istream/get")) and counted towards [gcount()](gcount.html "cpp/io/basic istream/gcount"), but is not stored. 
  3. count is non-positive, or count - 1 characters have been extracted (setstate(failbit) is called in this case). 



If the function extracts no characters, ​`failbit` is set in the local error state before [`setstate()`](../basic_ios/setstate.html "cpp/io/basic ios/setstate") is called. 

In any case, if count > 0, it then stores a null character CharT() into the next successive location of the array and updates [gcount()](gcount.html "cpp/io/basic istream/gcount").

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/basic_istream/getline&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

Because condition #2 is tested before condition #3, the input line that exactly fits the buffer does not trigger `failbit`. 

Because the terminating character is counted as an extracted character, an empty input line does not trigger `failbit`. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/basic_istream/getline&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Parameters")] Parameters

s  |  \-  |  pointer to the character string to store the characters to   
---|---|---  
count  |  \-  |  size of character string pointed to by s  
delim  |  \-  |  delimiting character to stop the extraction at. It is extracted but not stored.

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/basic_istream/getline&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Exceptions")] Exceptions

[[edit]](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Template:cpp/io/stream_exceptions&action=edit)

[failure](../ios_base/failure.html "cpp/io/ios base/failure") if an error occurred (the error state flag is not [goodbit](../ios_base/iostate.html "cpp/io/ios base/iostate")) and [exceptions()](../basic_ios/exceptions.html "cpp/io/basic ios/exceptions") is set to throw for that state. 

If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and [badbit](../ios_base/iostate.html "cpp/io/ios base/iostate") is set. If [exceptions()](../basic_ios/exceptions.html "cpp/io/basic ios/exceptions") is set for `badbit`, the exception is rethrown. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/basic_istream/getline&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Example")] Example

Run this code
    
    
    #include <array>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <sstream>
    #include <vector>
     
    int main()
    {
        [std::istringstream](../basic_istringstream.html) input("abc|def|gh");
        [std::vector](../../container/vector.html)<[std::array](../../container/array.html)<char, 4>> v;
     
        // note: the following loop terminates when std::ios_base::operator bool()
        // on the stream returned from getline() returns false
        for ([std::array](../../container/array.html)<char, 4> a; input.getline(&a[0], 4, '|');)
            v.push_back(a);
     
        for (auto& a : v)
            [std::cout](../cout.html) << &a[0] << '\n';
    }

Output:

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. 

DR  | Applied to  | Behavior as published  | Correct behavior   
---|---|---|---  
[LWG 531](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue531) | C++98  | `std::getline` could not handle the  
case where count is non-positive  | no character is  
extracted in this case
