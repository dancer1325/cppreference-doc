#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/ios_base/iostate&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: The eofbit")] The eofbit

The eofbit is set by the following standard library functions: 

  * The string input function [std::getline](../../string/basic_string/getline.html "cpp/string/basic string/getline") if it completes by reaching the end of the stream, as opposed to reaching the specified terminating character. 
  * The numeric input overloads of [`basic_istream::operator>>`](../basic_istream/operator_gtgt.html "cpp/io/basic istream/operator gtgt") if the end of the stream was encountered while reading the next character, on Stage 2 of [`num_get::get`](../../locale/num_get/get.html "cpp/locale/num get/get") processing. Depending on the parsing state, `failbit` may or may not be set at the same time: for example, int n; istringstream buf("1"); buf >> n; sets `eofbit`, but not `failbit`: the integer 1 was successfully parsed and stored in `n`. On the other hand, bool b; istringstream buf("tr"); buf >> boolalpha >> b; sets both `eofbit` and `failbit`: there was not enough characters to complete the parsing of the boolean true. 
  * The character extraction overloads of [`operator>>std::basic_istream`](../basic_istream/operator_gtgt2.html "cpp/io/basic istream/operator gtgt2"), if the end of the stream is reached before the limit (if any) on the number of characters to be extracted. 
  * The [std::get_time](../manip/get_time.html "cpp/io/manip/get time") I/O manipulator and any of the [std::time_get](../../locale/time_get.html "cpp/locale/time get") parsing functions: [`time_get::get`](../../locale/time_get/get.html "cpp/locale/time get/get"), [`time_get::get_time`](../../locale/time_get/get_time.html "cpp/locale/time get/get time"), [`time_get::get_date`](../../locale/time_get/get_date.html "cpp/locale/time get/get date"), etc., if the end of the stream is reached before the last character needed to parse the expected date/time value was processed. 
  * The [std::get_money](../manip/get_money.html "cpp/io/manip/get money") I/O manipulator and [`money_get::get`](../../locale/money_get/get.html "cpp/locale/money get/get") function, if the end of the stream is reached before the last character needed to parse the expected monetary value was processed. 
  * The [`basic_istream::sentry`](../basic_istream/sentry.html "cpp/io/basic istream/sentry") constructor, executed at the beginning of every formatted input function: unless the `skipws` bit is unset (e.g. by issuing [std::noskipws](../manip/skipws.html "cpp/io/manip/skipws")), sentry reads and discards the leading whitespace characters. If the end of the input stream is reached during this operation, both `eofbit` and `failbit` are set, and no input takes place. 
  * The I/O manipulator [std::ws](../manip/ws.html "cpp/io/manip/ws"), if it reaches the end of the stream while consuming whitespace (but, unlike the formatted input sentry, it does not set `failbit` in this case). 
  * The unformatted input functions [`basic_istream::read`](../basic_istream/read.html "cpp/io/basic istream/read"), [`basic_istream::get`](../basic_istream/get.html "cpp/io/basic istream/get"), [`basic_istream::peek`](../basic_istream/peek.html "cpp/io/basic istream/peek"), [`basic_istream::readsome`](../basic_istream/readsome.html "cpp/io/basic istream/readsome"), [`basic_istream::ignore`](../basic_istream/ignore.html "cpp/io/basic istream/ignore"), and [`basic_istream::getline`](../basic_istream/getline.html "cpp/io/basic istream/getline"), when reaching the end of the stream. 
  * The discard input function [`basic_istream::ignore`](../basic_istream/ignore.html "cpp/io/basic istream/ignore"), when reaching the end of the stream before reaching the specified delimiter character. 
  * The immediate input function [`basic_istream::readsome`](../basic_istream/readsome.html "cpp/io/basic istream/readsome"), if [`basic_streambuf::in_avail`](../basic_streambuf/in_avail.html "cpp/io/basic streambuf/in avail") returns -1. 



The following functions clear `eofbit` as a side-effect: 

  * [`basic_istream::putback`](../basic_istream/putback.html "cpp/io/basic istream/putback")
  * [`basic_istream::unget`](../basic_istream/unget.html "cpp/io/basic istream/unget")
  * [`basic_istream::seekg`](../basic_istream/seekg.html "cpp/io/basic istream/seekg")



Note that in nearly all situations, if eofbit is set, the failbit is set as well. 

#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/ios_base/iostate&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: The failbit")] The failbit

The failbit is set by the following standard library functions: 

  * The [`basic_istream::sentry`](../basic_istream/sentry.html "cpp/io/basic istream/sentry") constructor, executed at the beginning of every input function, if either `eofbit` or `badbit` is already set on the stream, or if the end of stream is encountered while consuming leading whitespace. 
  * The [`basic_ostream::sentry`](../basic_ostream/sentry.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/sentry") constructor, executed at the beginning of every output function, under implementation-defined conditions. 
  * [`operator>>(std::basic_string<>)`](../../string/basic_string/operator_ltltgtgt.html "cpp/string/basic string/operator ltltgtgt") if the function extracts no characters from the input stream. 
  * [`operator>>(std::complex<>)`](../../numeric/complex/operator_ltltgtgt.html "cpp/numeric/complex/operator ltltgtgt") if the function fails to extract a valid complex number. 
  * The character array and single character overloads of [`operator>>`](../basic_istream/operator_gtgt2.html "cpp/io/basic istream/operator gtgt2") if they fail to extract any characters. 
  * The streambuf overload of [`basic_istream::operator>>`](../basic_istream/operator_gtgt.html "cpp/io/basic istream/operator gtgt") if the streambuf argument is a null pointer or if no characters were inserted into the streambuf. 
  * The streambuf overload of [`basic_ostream::operator<<`](../basic_ostream/operator_ltlt.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/operator ltlt") if the function inserts no characters. 
  * [`operator>>(std::bitset<>)`](../../utility/bitset/operator_ltltgtgt2.html "cpp/utility/bitset/operator ltltgtgt2") if the function extracts no characters from the input stream. 
  * [std::getline](../../string/basic_string/getline.html "cpp/string/basic string/getline") if the function extracts no characters or if it manages to extract [`basic_string::max_size`](../../string/basic_string/max_size.html "cpp/string/basic string/max size") characters from the input stream. 
  * The numeric, pointer, and boolean input overloads of [`basic_istream::operator>>`](../basic_istream/operator_gtgt.html "cpp/io/basic istream/operator gtgt") (technically, the overloads of [`num_get::get`](../../locale/num_get/get.html "cpp/locale/num get/get") they call), if the input cannot be parsed as a valid value or if the value parsed does not fit in the destination type. 
  * The time input manipulator [std::get_time](../manip/get_time.html "cpp/io/manip/get time") (technically, [`time_get::get`](../../locale/time_get/get.html "cpp/locale/time get/get") it calls), if the input cannot be unambiguously parsed as a time value according to the given format string. 
  * The currency input manipulator [std::get_money](../manip/get_money.html "cpp/io/manip/get money") (technically, [`money_get::get`](../../locale/money_get/get.html "cpp/locale/money get/get") it calls), if the input cannot be unambiguously parsed as a monetary value according to the locale rules. 
  * The extraction operators of all [RandomNumberEngines](../../named_req/RandomNumberEngine.html "cpp/named req/RandomNumberEngine"), if bad input is encountered. 
  * The extraction operators of all [RandomNumberDistributions](../../named_req/RandomNumberDistribution.html "cpp/named req/RandomNumberDistribution"), if bad input is encountered. 
  * The unformatted input functions [`basic_istream::get`](../basic_istream/get.html "cpp/io/basic istream/get") if they fails to extract any characters. 
  * [`basic_istream::getline`](../basic_istream/getline.html "cpp/io/basic istream/getline"), if it extracts no characters, if it fills in the provided buffer without encountering the delimiter, or if the provided buffer size is less than 1. 
  * [`basic_istream::read`](../basic_istream/read.html "cpp/io/basic istream/read"), if the end-of-file condition occurs on the input stream before all requested characters could be extracted. 
  * [`basic_istream::seekg`](../basic_istream/seekg.html "cpp/io/basic istream/seekg") on failure 
  * [`basic_ostream::tellp`](../basic_ostream/tellp.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/tellp") on failure 
  * The constructors of [std::basic_fstream](../basic_fstream.html "cpp/io/basic fstream"), [std::basic_ifstream](../basic_ifstream.html "cpp/io/basic ifstream"), and [std::basic_ofstream](../basic_ofstream.html "cpp/io/basic ofstream") that takes a filename argument, if the file cannot be opened. 
  * [`basic_fstream::open`](../basic_fstream/open.html "cpp/io/basic fstream/open"), [`basic_ifstream::open`](../basic_ifstream/open.html "cpp/io/basic ifstream/open"), and [`basic_ofstream::open`](../basic_ofstream/open.html "cpp/io/basic ofstream/open") if the file cannot be opened. 
  * [`basic_fstream::close`](../basic_fstream/close.html "cpp/io/basic fstream/close"), [`basic_ifstream::close`](../basic_ifstream/close.html "cpp/io/basic ifstream/close"), and [`basic_ofstream::close`](../basic_ofstream/close.html "cpp/io/basic ofstream/close") if the file cannot be closed. 



#### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/ios_base/iostate&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The badbit")] The badbit

The badbit is set by the following standard library functions: 

  * [`basic_ostream::put`](../basic_ostream/put.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/put") if it fails to insert a character into the output stream, for any reason. 
  * [`basic_ostream::write`](../basic_ostream/write.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/write") if it fails to insert a character into the output stream, for any reason. 
  * Formatted output functions [operator<<](../basic_ostream/operator_ltlt.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/operator ltlt"), [std::put_money](../manip/put_money.html "cpp/io/manip/put money"), and [std::put_time](../manip/put_time.html "cpp/io/manip/put time"), if they encounter the end of the output stream before completing output. 
  * [`basic_ios::init`](../basic_ios/init.html "cpp/io/basic ios/init") when called to initialize a stream with a null pointer for `rdbuf()`. 
  * [`basic_istream::putback`](../basic_istream/putback.html "cpp/io/basic istream/putback") and [`basic_istream::unget`](../basic_istream/unget.html "cpp/io/basic istream/unget") when called on a stream with a null `rdbuf()`. 
  * [`basic_ostream::operator<<(basic_streambuf*)`](../basic_ostream/operator_ltlt.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/operator ltlt") when a null pointer is passed as the argument. 
  * [`basic_istream::putback`](../basic_istream/putback.html "cpp/io/basic istream/putback") and [`basic_istream::unget`](../basic_istream/unget.html "cpp/io/basic istream/unget") if rdbuf()->sputbackc() or rdbuf()->sungetc() return traits::eof(). 
  * [`basic_istream::sync`](../basic_istream/sync.html "cpp/io/basic istream/sync"), [`basic_ostream::flush`](../basic_ostream/flush.html "cpp/io/basic ostream/flush"), and every output function on a `unitbuf` output stream, if rdbuf()->pubsync() returns -1. 
  * Every stream I/O function if an exception is thrown by any member function of the associated stream buffer (e.g. `sbumpc()`, `xsputn()`, `sgetc()`, `overflow()`, etc). 
  * [`ios_base::iword`](iword.html "cpp/io/ios base/iword") and [`ios_base::pword`](pword.html "cpp/io/ios base/pword") on failure (e.g. failure to allocate memory).
