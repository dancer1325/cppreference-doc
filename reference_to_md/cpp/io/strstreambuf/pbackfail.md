virtual int_type pbackfail( int_type c = [EOF](../c.html) ); |  |  (deprecated in C++98)   
(removed in C++26)  
---|---|---  
| |   
  
This protected virtual function is called by the public functions [`basic_streambuf::sungetc`](../basic_streambuf/sungetc.html "cpp/io/basic streambuf/sungetc") and [`basic_streambuf::sputbackc`](../basic_streambuf/sputbackc.html "cpp/io/basic streambuf/sputbackc") (which, in turn, are called by [`basic_istream::unget`](../basic_istream/unget.html "cpp/io/basic istream/unget") and [`basic_istream::putback`](../basic_istream/putback.html "cpp/io/basic istream/putback")). 

1) The caller is requesting that the get area is backed up by one character (`pbackfail()` is called with no arguments or with [EOF](../c.html "cpp/io/c") as the argument)

a) First, checks if there is a putback position, and if there really isn't, fails (`strstreambuf` has no external character source to re-read).

b) If the caller was wrong and the putback position is in fact available, simply decrements [`basic_streambuf::gptr()`](../basic_streambuf/gptr.html "cpp/io/basic streambuf/gptr"), e.g. by calling gbump(-1).

2) The caller attempts to putback a different character from the one retrieved earlier (`pbackfail()` is called with the character that needs to be put back), in which case

a) First, checks if there is a putback position, and if there isn't, fails.

b) Then checks what character is in the putback position. If the character held there is already equal to (char)c, then simply decrements [`basic_streambuf::gptr()`](../basic_streambuf/gptr.html "cpp/io/basic streambuf/gptr").

c) Otherwise, if the buffer is unmodifiable (this strstreambuf was constructed with a string literal or some other const array), fails.

d) Otherwise, decrements [`basic_streambuf::gptr()`](../basic_streambuf/gptr.html "cpp/io/basic streambuf/gptr") and writes c to the location pointed to gptr() after adjustment.

### Parameters

c  |  \-  |  the character to put back, or Traits::eof() to indicate that backing up of the get area is requested   
---|---|---  
  
### Return value

c on success except if c was [EOF](../c.html "cpp/io/c"), in which case unspecified value other than [EOF](../c.html "cpp/io/c") is returned. 

[EOF](../c.html "cpp/io/c") on failure.
