Comments serve as a sort of in-code documentation. When inserted into a program, they are effectively ignored by the compiler; they are solely intended to be used as notes by the humans that read source code.

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/comment&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Syntax")] Syntax  
  
---  
`**/***` comment `***/**` |  (1)  |   
`**//**` comment |  (2)  |  (since C99)  
  
1) Often known as "C-style" or "multi-line" comments.

2) Often known as "C++-style" or "single-line" comments.

All comments are removed from the program at [translation phase 3](language/translation_phases.html "c/language/translation phases") by replacing each comment with a single whitespace character. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/comment&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: C-style")] C-style

C-style comments are usually used to comment large blocks of text or small fragments of code; however, they can be used to comment single lines. To insert text as a C-style comment, simply surround the text with `/*` and `*/`. C-style comments tell the compiler to ignore all content between `/*` and `*/`. Although it is not part of the C standard, `/**` and `**/` are often used to indicate documentation blocks; this is legal because the second asterisk is simply treated as part of the comment. 

Except within a [character constant](language/character_constant.html "c/language/character constant"), a [string literal](language/string_literal.html "c/language/string literal"), or a comment, the characters `/*` introduce a comment. The contents of such a comment are examined only to identify multibyte characters and to find the characters `*/` that terminate the comment. C-style comments cannot be nested. 

###  C++-style

C++-style comments are usually used to comment single lines of text or code; however, they can be placed together to form multi-line comments. To insert text as a C++-style comment, simply precede the text with `//` and follow the text with the new line character. C++-style comments tell the compiler to ignore all content between `//` and a new line. Except within a [character constant](language/character_constant.html "c/language/character constant"), a [string literal](language/string_literal.html "c/language/string literal"), or a comment, the characters `//` introduce a comment that includes all multibyte characters up to, but not including, the next new-line character. The contents of such a comment are examined only to identify multibyte characters and to find the new-line character that terminates the comment. C++-style comments can be nested: 
    
    
    //  y = f(x);   // invoke algorithm

A C-style comment may appear within a C++-style comment: 
    
    
    //  y = f(x);   /* invoke algorithm */

A C++-style comment may appear within a C-style comment; this is a mechanism for excluding a small block of source code: 
    
    
    /*
        y = f(x);   // invoke algorithms
        z = g(x);
    */

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/comment&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

Because comments [are removed](language/translation_phases.html "c/language/translation phases") before the preprocessor stage, a macro cannot be used to form a comment and an unterminated C-style comment doesn't spill over from an #include'd file. 
    
    
    /* An attempt to use a macro to form a comment. */
    /* But, a space replaces characters "//".       */
    #ifndef DEBUG
        #define PRINTF //
    #else
        #define PRINTF printf
    #endif
    ...  
    PRINTF("Error in file %s at line %i\n", __FILE__, __LINE__);

Besides commenting out, other mechanisms used for source code exclusion are: 
    
    
    #if 0
        [puts](io/puts.html)("this will not be compiled");
        /* no conflict with C-style comments */
        // no conflict with C++-style comments
    #endif

and 
    
    
    if(0) {
        [puts](io/puts.html)("this will be compiled but not be executed");
        /* no conflict with C-style comments */
        // no conflict with C++-style comments
    }

The introduction of // comments in C99 was a breaking change in some rare circumstances: 
    
    
    a = b //*divisor:*/ c
    + d; /* C89 compiles a = b / c + d;
            C99 compiles a = b + d; */

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/comment&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Example")] Example

Run this code
    
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    /*
    C-style comments can contain
    multiple lines.
    */
     
    /* Or, just one line. */
     
    // C++-style comments can comment one line.
     
    // Or, they can
    // be strung together.
     
    int main(void)
    {
      // The below code won't be run
      // puts("Hello");
     
      // The below code will be run
      [puts](io/puts.html)("World");
     
      // A note regarding backslash + newline.
      // Despite belonging to translation phase 2 (vs phase 3 for comments),
      // '\' still determines which portion of the source code is considered
      // as 'comments':
      // This comment will be promoted to the next line \
      puts("Won't be run"); // may issue a warning "multi-line comment"
      [puts](io/puts.html)("Hello, again");
    }

Output: 
    
    
    World
    Hello, again
