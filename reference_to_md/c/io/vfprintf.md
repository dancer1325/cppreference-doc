Loads the data from the locations, defined by vlist, converts them to character string equivalents and writes the results to a variety of sinks. 

1) Writes the results to [stdout](std_streams.html "c/io/std streams").

2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.

3) Writes the results to a character string buffer.

4) Writes the results to a character string buffer. At most bufsz - 1 characters are written. The resulting character string will be terminated with a null character, unless bufsz is zero. If bufsz is zero, nothing is written and buffer may be a null pointer, however the return value (number of bytes that would be written not including the null terminator) is still calculated and returned.

5-8) Same as (1-4), except that the following errors are detected at runtime and call the currently installed [constraint handler](../error/set_constraint_handler_s.html "c/error/set constraint handler s") function: 

    

  * the conversion specifier `%n` is present in format
  * any of the arguments corresponding to `%s` is a null pointer 
  * format or buffer is a null pointer 
  * bufsz is zero or greater than RSIZE_MAX
  * encoding errors occur in any of string and character conversion specifiers 
  * (for `vsprintf_s` only), the string to be stored in buffer (including the trailing null)) would be exceed bufsz


As with all bounds-checked functions, `vprintf_s`, `vfprintf_s`, `vsprintf_s`, and `vsnprintf_s` are only guaranteed to be available if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the implementation and if the user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1 before including [`<stdio.h>`](../header/stdio.html "c/header/stdio").

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/io/vfprintf&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Parameters")] Parameters

stream  |  \-  |  output file stream to write to   
---|---|---  
buffer  |  \-  |  pointer to a character string to write to   
bufsz  |  \-  |  up to bufsz - 1 characters may be written, plus the null terminator   
format  |  \-  |  pointer to a null-terminated character string specifying how to interpret the data   
vlist  |  \-  |  variable argument list containing the data to print.   
  
The **format** string consists of ordinary byte characters (except `**%**`), which are copied unchanged into the output stream, and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format: 

    

  * introductory `**%**` character. 



    

  * (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the conversion: 



    

  * `**-**`: the result of the conversion is left-justified within the field (by default it is right-justified). 
  * `**+**`: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to the result of the conversion (by default the result is preceded by minus only when it is negative). 
  * _space_ : if the result of a signed conversion does not start with a sign character, or is empty, space is prepended to the result. It is ignored if `+` flag is present. 
  * `**#**`: _alternative form_ of the conversion is performed. See the table below for exact effects otherwise the behavior is undefined. 
  * `**0**`: for integer and floating-point number conversions, leading zeros are used to pad the field instead of _space_ characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the precision is explicitly specified. For other conversions using this flag results in undefined behavior. It is ignored if `-` flag is present. 



    

  * (optional) integer value or `*` that specifies minimum field width. The result is padded with _space_ characters (by default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on the right if left-justified. In the case when `*` is used, the width is specified by an additional argument of type int, which appears before the argument to be converted and the argument supplying precision if one is supplied. If the value of the argument is negative, it results with the `-` flag specified and positive field width (Note: This is the minimum width: The value is never truncated.). 



    

  * (optional) `**.**` followed by integer number or `*****`, or neither that specifies _precision_ of the conversion. In the case when `*` is used, the _precision_ is specified by an additional argument of type int, which appears before the argument to be converted, but after the argument supplying minimum field width if one is supplied. If the value of this argument is negative, it is ignored. If neither a number nor `*****` is used, the precision is taken as zero. See the table below for exact effects of _precision_. 



    

  * (optional) _length modifier_ that specifies the size of the argument (in combination with the conversion format specifier, it specifies the type of the corresponding argument). 



    

  * conversion format specifier. 



The following format specifiers are available: 

Conversion  
Specifier  | Explanation  | Expected  
Argument Type   
---|---|---  
Length Modifier→  | hh  | h  | none  | l  | ll  | j  | z  | t  | L   
Only available since C99→  | Yes |  |  |  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |   
`%` | Writes literal `**%**`. The full conversion specification must be `**%%**`.  |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A  
`c` |  Writes a **single character**. 

  * The argument is first converted to unsigned char. 
  * If the **l** modifier is used, the argument is first converted to a character string as if by **%ls** with a wchar_t[2] argument. 

|  N/A |  N/A | int | wint_t |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A  
`s` |  Writes a **character string**. 

  * The argument must be a pointer to the initial element of an array of characters. 
  * _Precision_ specifies the maximum number of bytes to be written. If _Precision_ is not specified, writes every byte up to and not including the first null terminator. 
  * If the **l** specifier is used, the argument must be a pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t, which is converted to char array as if by a call to [wcrtomb](../string/multibyte/wcrtomb.html "c/string/multibyte/wcrtomb") with zero-initialized conversion state. 

|  N/A |  N/A | char* | wchar_t* |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A  
`d`  
`i` |  Converts a **signed integer** into decimal representation _[-]dddd_. 

  * _Precision_ specifies the minimum number of digits to appear. The default precision is 1. 
  * If both the converted value and the precision are ​0​ the conversion results in no characters. 
  * For the `**z**` modifier, the expected argument type is the signed version of [size_t](../types/size_t.html "c/types/size t").

  * _Precision_ specifies the minimum number of digits to appear. The default precision is 1. 
  * If both the converted value and the precision are ​0​ the conversion results in no characters. 
  * In the _alternative implementation_ precision is increased if necessary, to write one leading zero. In that case if both the converted value and the precision are ​0​, single ​0​ is written. 

| unsigned char | unsigned short | unsigned int | unsigned long | unsigned long long | [uintmax_t](../types/integer.html "c/types/integer") | [size_t](../types/size_t.html "c/types/size t") | unsigned version of [ptrdiff_t](../types/ptrdiff_t.html "c/types/ptrdiff t") |  N/A

`F` (C99) |  Converts **floating-point number** to the decimal notation in the style _[-]ddd.ddd_. 

  * _Precision_ specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the decimal point character. 
  * The default precision is 6. 
  * In the _alternative implementation_ decimal point character is written even if no digits follow it. 
  * For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see [notes](vfprintf.html#Notes). 

|  N/A |  N/A | double | double (C99) |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A | long double  
`e`  
`E` |  Converts **floating-point number** to the decimal exponent notation. 

  * For the `**e**` conversion style _[-]d.ddd_ ﻿`**e**` _±dd_ is used. 
  * For the `**E**` conversion style _[-]d.ddd_ ﻿`**E**` _±dd_ is used. 
  * The exponent contains at least two digits, more digits are used only if necessary.

  * For the `**A**` conversion style _[-]_ ﻿`**0X**` _h.hhh_ ﻿`**P**` _±d_ is used. 
  * The first hexadecimal digit is not `0` if the argument is a normalized floating-point value. 
  * If the value is ​0​, the exponent is also ​0​. 
  * _Precision_ specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the hexadecimal point character. 
  * The default precision is sufficient for exact representation of the value. 
  * In the _alternative implementation_ decimal point character is written even if no digits follow it. 
  * For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see [notes](vfprintf.html#Notes).

`g`  
`G` |  Converts **floating-point number** to decimal or decimal exponent notation depending on the value and the _precision_. 

  * For the `**g**` conversion style conversion with style `**e**` or `**f**` will be performed. 
  * For the `**G**` conversion style conversion with style `**E**` or `**f**`(until C99)`**F**`(since C99) will be performed. 
  * Let `P` equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is not specified, or 1 if the precision is ​0​. Then, if a conversion with style `E` would have an exponent of `X`: 
    * If _P > X ≥ −4_, the conversion is with style `**f**` or `**F**`(since C99) and precision _P − 1 − X_. 
    * Otherwise, the conversion is with style `**e**` or `**E**` and precision _P − 1_. 
  * Unless _alternative representation_ is requested the trailing zeros are removed, also the decimal point character is removed if no fractional part is left. 
  * For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see [notes](vfprintf.html#Notes). 

|  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A |  N/A

  * The specification may not contain any _flag_ , _field width_ , or _precision_. 
  * For the `**z**` modifier, the expected argument type is S*, where `S` is the signed version of [size_t](../types/size_t.html). 

| signed char* | short* | int* | long* | long long* | [intmax_t](../types/integer.html "c/types/integer")* | ※ |  [ptrdiff_t](../types/ptrdiff_t.html "c/types/ptrdiff t")* |  N/A

Notes  
The floating-point conversion functions convert infinity to `inf` or `infinity`. Which one is used is implementation defined. Not-a-number is converted to `nan` or `nan(_char_sequence_)`. Which one is used is implementation defined. The conversions `**F**`, `**E**`, `**G**`, `**A**` output `INF`, `INFINITY`, `NAN` instead. The conversion specifier used to print char, unsigned char, signed char, short, and unsigned short expects promoted types of [default argument promotions](../language/conversion.html#Default_argument_promotions "c/language/conversion"), but before printing its value will be converted to char, unsigned char, signed char, short, and unsigned short. It is safe to pass values of these types because of the promotion that takes place when a variadic function is called. The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character types ([int8_t](../types/integer.html "c/types/integer"), etc) are defined in the header [`<inttypes.h>`](../header/inttypes.html "c/header/inttypes") (although [PRIdMAX](../types/integer.html "c/types/integer"), [PRIuMAX](../types/integer.html "c/types/integer"), etc is synonymous with `%jd`, `%ju`, etc). The memory-writing conversion specifier `%n` is a common target of security exploits where format strings depend on user input and is not supported by the bounds-checked `printf_s` family of functions(since C11). There is a [sequence point](../language/eval_order.html "c/language/eval order") after the action of each conversion specifier; this permits storing multiple `%n` results in the same variable or, as an edge case, printing a string modified by an earlier `%n` within the same call. If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.   
  
### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/io/vfprintf&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Return value")] Return value

1-3) The number of characters written if successful or negative value if an error occurred.

4) The number of characters written if successful or negative value if an error occurred. If the resulting string gets truncated due to buf_size limit, function returns the total number of characters (not including the terminating null-byte) which would have been written, if the limit was not imposed.

5,6) number of characters transmitted to the output stream or negative value if an output error, a runtime constrants violation error, or an encoding error occurred.

7) number of characters written to buffer, not counting the null character (which is always written as long as buffer is not a null pointer and bufsz is not zero and not greater than RSIZE_MAX), or zero on runtime constraint violations, and negative value on encoding errors

8) number of characters not including the terminating null character (which is always written as long as buffer is not a null pointer and bufsz is not zero and not greater than RSIZE_MAX), which would have been written to buffer if bufsz was ignored, or a negative value if a runtime constraints violation or an encoding error occurred

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/io/vfprintf&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

All these functions invoke va_arg at least once, the value of arg is indeterminate after the return. These functions do not invoke va_end, and it must be done by the caller. 

`vsnprintf_s`, unlike `vsprintf_s`, will truncate the result to fit within the array pointed to by buffer. 

The implementation of `vsnprintf_s` in the [Microsoft CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/vsnprintf-s-vsnprintf-s-vsnprintf-s-l-vsnwprintf-s-vsnwprintf-s-l) does not conform to the C standard. Microsoft's version has an extra parameter [size_t](../types/size_t.html) count in third position that contains the maximum amount of characters to be written, not including the null terminator. This parameter is possibly distinct from the buffer size provided via the parameter [size_t](../types/size_t.html) bufsz.
