This section provides definitions for the specific terminology and the concepts used when describing the C programming language. 

A C program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source files) that contain [declarations](declarations.html "c/language/declarations"). They undergo [translation](translation_phases.html "c/language/translation phases") to become an executable program, which is executed when the OS calls its [main function](main_function.html "c/language/main function") (unless it is itself the OS or another _freestanding_ program, in which case the entry point is implementation-defined). 

Certain words in a C program have special meaning, they are [keywords](../keyword.html "c/keyword"). Others can be used as [identifiers](identifiers.html "c/language/identifier"), which may be used to identify [objects](object.html "c/language/object"), [functions](functions.html "c/language/functions"), [struct](struct.html "c/language/struct"), [union](union.html "c/language/union"), or [enumeration](enum.html "c/language/enum") tags, their members, [typedef](typedef.html "c/language/typedef") names, [labels](statements.html#Labels "c/language/statements"), or [macros](../preprocessor/replace.html "c/preprocessor/replace"). 

Each identifier (other than macro) is only valid within a part of the program called its [scope](scope.html "c/language/scope") and belongs to one of four kinds of [name spaces](name_space.html "c/language/name space"). Some identifiers have [linkage](storage_class_specifiers.html "c/language/storage duration") which makes them refer to the same entities when they appear in different scopes or translation units. 

Definitions of functions include sequences of [statements](statements.html "c/language/statements") and [declarations](declarations.html "c/language/declarations"), some of which include [expressions](operators.html "c/language/expressions"), which specify the computations to be performed by the program. 

[Declarations](declarations.html "c/language/declarations") and [expressions](operators.html "c/language/expressions") create, destroy, access, and manipulate [objects](object.html "c/language/object"). Each [object](object.html "c/language/object"), [function](functions.html "c/language/functions"), and [expression](operators.html "c/language/expressions") in C is associated with a [type](compatible_type.html "c/language/type").
