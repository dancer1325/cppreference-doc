  1. [↑](operator_precedence.html#cite_ref-1) The operand of prefix `++` and `--` can't be a type cast. This rule grammatically forbids some expressions that would be semantically invalid anyway. Some compilers ignore this rule and detect the invalidity semantically.
  2. [↑](operator_precedence.html#cite_ref-2) The operand of `sizeof` can't be a type cast: the expression sizeof (int) * p is unambiguously interpreted as (sizeof(int)) * p, but not sizeof((int)*p).
  3. [↑](operator_precedence.html#cite_ref-3) The expression in the middle of the conditional operator (between `**?**` and `**:**`) is parsed as if parenthesized: its precedence relative to `?:` is ignored.
  4. [↑](operator_precedence.html#cite_ref-4) Assignment operators' left operands must be unary (level-2 non-cast) expressions. This rule grammatically forbids some expressions that would be semantically invalid anyway. Many compilers ignore this rule and detect the invalidity semantically. For example, e = a < d ? a++ : a = d is an expression that cannot be parsed because of this rule. However, many compilers ignore this rule and parse it as e = ( ((a < d) ? (a++) : a) = d ), and then give an error because it is semantically invalid.



When parsing an expression, an operator which is listed on some row will be bound tighter (as if by parentheses) to its arguments than any operator that is listed on a row further below it. For example, the expression *p++ is parsed as *(p++), and not as (*p)++. 

Operators that are in the same cell (there may be several rows of operators listed in a cell) are evaluated with the same precedence, in the given direction. For example, the expression a=b=c is parsed as a=(b=c), and not as (a=b)=c because of right-to-left associativity. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/operator_precedence&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

Precedence and associativity are independent from [order of evaluation](eval_order.html "c/language/eval order"). 

The standard itself doesn't specify precedence levels. They are derived from the grammar. 

In C++, the conditional operator has the same precedence as assignment operators, and prefix `++` and `--` and assignment operators don't have the restrictions about their operands. 

Associativity specification is redundant for unary operators and is only shown for completeness: unary prefix operators always associate right-to-left (sizeof ++*p is sizeof(++(*p))) and unary postfix operators always associate left-to-right (a[1][2]++ is ((a[1])[2])++). Note that the associativity is meaningful for member access operators, even though they are grouped with unary postfix operators: a.b++ is parsed (a.b)++ and not a.(b++).
