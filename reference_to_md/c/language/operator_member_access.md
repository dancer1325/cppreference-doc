### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/operator_member_access&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Subscript")] Subscript

The array subscript expression has the form   
  
---  
pointer-expression `**[**` integer-expression `**]**` |  (1)  |   
integer-expression `**[**` pointer-expression `**]**` |  (2)  |   
  
where 

pointer-expression |  \-  |  an [expression](operators.html "c/language/expressions") of type pointer to complete object   
---|---|---  
integer-expression |  \-  |  an [expression](operators.html "c/language/expressions") of integer type   
  
The subscript operator expression is an [lvalue expression](value_category.html "c/language/value category") whose type is the type of the object pointed to by pointer-expression. 

By definition, the subscript operator E1[E2] is exactly identical to *((E1)+(E2)). If pointer-expression is an array expression, it undergoes [lvalue-to-rvalue conversion](conversion.html "c/language/conversion") and becomes a pointer to the first element of the array. 

Due to the definition of the [addition between a pointer and an integer](operator_arithmetic.html "c/language/operator arithmetic"), the result is the element of the array with the index equal to the result of integer-expression (or, if pointer-expression was pointing at ith element of some array, the index of the result is i plus the result of integer-expression) 

Note: see [array](array.html "c/language/array") for the details on multidimensional arrays. 

Run this code
    
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        int a[3] = {1,2,3};
        [printf](../io/fprintf.html)("%d %d\n", a[2],  // n == 3
                          2[a]); // same, n == 3
        a[2] = 7; // subscripts are lvalues
     
        int n[2][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}};
        int (*p)[3] = &n[1]; // elements of n are arrays
        [printf](../io/fprintf.html)("%d %d %d\n", (*p)[0], p[0][1], p[0][2]); // access n[1][] via p
        int x = n[1][2]; // applying [] again to the array n[1]
        [printf](../io/fprintf.html)("%d\n", x);
     
        [printf](../io/fprintf.html)("%c %c\n", "abc"[2], 2["abc"]); // string literals are arrays too
    }

Output: 
    
    
    3 3
    4 5 6
    6
    c c

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/operator_member_access&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Dereference")] Dereference

The _dereference_ or _indirection_ expression has the form   
  
---  
`*****` pointer-expression |  |   
  
where 

pointer-expression |  \-  |  an [expression](operators.html "c/language/expressions") of any pointer type   
---|---|---  
  
If pointer-expression is a pointer to function, the result of the dereference operator is a function designator for that function. 

If pointer-expression is a pointer to object, the result is an [lvalue expression](value_category.html "c/language/value category") that designates the pointed-to object. 

Dereferencing a null pointer, a pointer to an object outside of its lifetime (a dangling pointer), a misaligned pointer, or a pointer with indeterminate value is undefined behavior, except when the dereference operator is nullified by applying the address-of operator to its result, as in &*E. 

Run this code
    
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        int n = 1;
        int* p = &n;
        [printf](../io/fprintf.html)("*p = %d\n", *p); // the value of *p is what's stored in n
        *p = 7; // *p is lvalue
        [printf](../io/fprintf.html)("*p = %d\n", *p);
    }

Output: 
    
    
    *p = 1
    *p = 7

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/operator_member_access&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Address of")] Address of

The address-of expression has the form   
  
---  
`**&**` function |  (1)  |   
`**&**` lvalue-expression |  (2)  |   
`**&**` `*****` expression |  (3)  |   
`**&**` expression `**[**` expression `**]**` |  (4)  |   
  
1) address of a function

2) address of an object

3) special case: `&` and `*` cancel each other, neither one is evaluated

4) special case: `&` and the `*` that is implied in `[]` cancel each other, only the addition implied in `[]` is evaluated.

where 

lvalue-expression |  \-  |  an [lvalue](value_category.html "c/language/value category") expression of any type that is not a [bit-field](bit_field.html "c/language/bit field") and does not have [register](storage_class_specifiers.html "c/language/storage duration") storage class   
---|---|---  
  
The address-of operator produces the [non-lvalue](value_category.html "c/language/value category") address of its operand, suitable for initializing a pointer to the type of the operand. If the operand is a function designator (1), the result is a pointer to function. If the operand is an object (2), the result is a pointer to object. 

If the operand is the dereference operator, no action is taken (so it's okay to apply &* to a null pointer), except that the result is not an lvalue. 

If the operand is an array index expression, no action is taken other than the array-to-pointer conversion and the addition, so &a[N] is valid for an array of size N (obtaining a pointer one past the end is okay, dereferencing it is not, but dereference cancels out in this expression). 

Run this code
    
    
    int f(char c) { return c;}
    int main(void)
    {
       int n = 1;
       int *p = &n; // address of object n
       int (*fp)(char) = &f; // address of function f
       int a[3] = {1,2,3};
       int *beg=a, *end=&a[3]; // same as end = a+3
    }

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/operator_member_access&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Member access")] Member access

The member access expression has the form   
  
---  
expression `**.**` member-name |  |   
  
where 

expression |  \-  |  an expression of [struct](struct.html "c/language/struct") or [union](union.html "c/language/union") type   
---|---|---  
member-name |  \-  |  an [identifier](identifiers.html "c/language/identifier") that names a member of the struct or union designated by expression  
  
The member access expression designates the named member of the [struct](struct.html "c/language/struct") or [union](union.html "c/language/union") designated by its left operand. It has the same [value category](value_category.html "c/language/value category") as its left operand. 

If the left operand is [const](const.html "c/language/const") or [volatile](volatile.html "c/language/volatile") qualified, the result is also qualified. If the left operand is [atomic](atomic.html "c/language/atomic"), the behavior is undefined. 

Note: besides identifiers that name objects of struct or union type, the following expressions may have struct or union types: [assignment](operator_assignment.html "c/language/operator assignment"), [function call](operator_other.html#Function_call "c/language/operator other"), [comma operator](operator_other.html#Comma_operator "c/language/operator other"), [conditional operator](operator_other.html#Conditional_operator "c/language/operator other"), and [compound literal](compound_literal.html "c/language/compound literal"). 

Run this code
    
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    struct s {int x;};
    struct s f(void) { return (struct s){1}; }
    int main(void)
    {
        struct s s;
        s.x = 1; // ok, changes the member of s
        int n = f().x; // f() is an expression of type struct s
    //  f().x = 1; // Error: this member access expression is not an lvalue
     
        const struct s sc;
    //  sc.x = 3;  // Error: sc.x is const, can't be assigned
     
        union { int x; double d; } u = {1};
        u.d = 0.1; // changes the active member of the union
    }

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/operator_member_access&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Member access through pointer")] Member access through pointer

The member access expression has the form   
  
---  
expression `**- >**` member-name |  |   
  
where 

expression |  \-  |  an expression of type [pointer](pointer.html "c/language/pointer") to [struct](struct.html "c/language/struct") or [union](union.html "c/language/union")  
---|---|---  
member-name |  \-  |  an [identifier](identifiers.html "c/language/identifier") that names a member of the struct or union pointed by expression  
  
The member access through pointer expression designates the named member of the [struct](struct.html "c/language/struct") or [union](union.html "c/language/union") type pointed to by its left operand. Its value category is always [lvalue](value_category.html "c/language/value category")

If the type pointed to by the left operand is [const](const.html "c/language/const") or [volatile](volatile.html "c/language/volatile") qualified, the result is also qualified. If the type pointed to by the left operand is [atomic](atomic.html "c/language/atomic"), the behavior is undefined. 

Run this code
    
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    struct s {int x;};
    int main(void)
    {
        struct s s={1}, *p = &s;
        p->x = 7; // changes the value of s.x through the pointer
        [printf](../io/fprintf.html)("%d\n", p->x); // prints 7
    }
